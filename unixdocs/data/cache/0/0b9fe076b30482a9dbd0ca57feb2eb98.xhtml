<div class="level1">

<p>
This is the screen capture from FileZilla V3.14.1 Windows Client that now, on standard open, requires TSL security if advertised by the server.
</p>

<p>
To connect to Tenneco Servers users who have this version will now need to set up individual site definitions for each server they wish to establish an ftp connection with.
On the main FileZilla Screen 
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=chris%3Amigratebadetohmc&amp;media=chris:00picture.png" class="media" title="chris:00picture.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chris:00picture.png" class="media" alt="" /></a></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Users will now have to go to File and then select Site Manager 
And set up the access for the particular server as shown below using ftp1.tenneco.com with user id customer as an example
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=chris%3Amigratebadetohmc&amp;media=chris:01picture.png" class="media" title="chris:01picture.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chris:01picture.png" class="media" alt="" /></a></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the example below I have created two folders, DMZ Servers, and Non DMZ servers. This is my own preference and for my own convenience.  You do not have to create folders.
</p>

<p>
Under each folder I have created example sites.  You will need to create a site for each server you wish to establish an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> connection with. 
</p>

<p>
Below is the example for a simple connection with plain ftp. No security. This is equivalent to the default settings under FileZilla V3.9.0.6.  Note that the Protocol selected is <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> File Transfer Protocol and that the Encryption selected is Only use plain <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> (insecure).
</p>

<p>
Change the Logon Type to Normal as shown.  Enter the user name you want to connect to and the password.
To save the entry and connect to to the server click on the Connect button.   To save the entry and exit withour making a connection click on the OK button. This will close save your entry and return to the FileZilla main screen.
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <a href="/lib/exe/detail.php?id=chris%3Amigratebadetohmc&amp;media=chris:02picture.png" class="media" title="chris:02picture.png"><img src="/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=chris:02picture.png" class="media" alt="" /></a></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To connect to servers that use sftp SFTP <abbr title="Secure Shell">SSH</abbr> File Transfer Protocol.. The Protocol selected. You do not need to enter the Port number.  Enter the user name you want to connect to and the password.
To save the entry and connect to the server click on the Connect  button.   To save the entry and exit without making a connection click on the OK button. This will close save your entry and return to the FileZilla main screen.
