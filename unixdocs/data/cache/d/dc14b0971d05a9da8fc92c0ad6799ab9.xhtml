<p>
This command should be used with caution.  It was provided by IBM for the purpose of recovering the server profile data when it is in recovery mode. It is hereby noted that this command was provided by IBM after submitting pedbg output from both HMC&#039;s (tgprhmc5 and tgprhmc6) for analysis. It was noted by IBM that this command is normally executed when the server is in &#039;Standby‚Äù mode.  The levels shown here 2 and, 3 per IBM should not cause the server to power cycle.  <strong>Again caution is urged when executing the  rstprofdata  command as several of the levels may result in a reboot / power cycle of the server.</strong>
</p>
<pre class="code"> rstprofdata -m &lt;system name&gt; -l 3 -f backupFile </pre>

<p>
  if that does not work then ty the following 
</p>
<pre class="code">  rstprofdata -m &lt;system name&gt; -l 2 -f backupFile </pre>

<p>
 where &lt;system name&gt; is the managed system name.
