Issue  Disable Transparent Huge Pages on below servers

TAITC491     RHEL6.6    
TAROS492   RHEL6.6
TASHA493   RHEL6.6

To disable THP at boot time
Append the following to the kernel command line in grub.conf:
transparent_hugepage=never  
</p>
<pre class="code">sudo cp -p /boot/grub/grub.conf  </pre>
<pre class="code">echo &quot;transparent_hugepage=never&quot;  | sudo tee -a  /boot/grub/grub.conf </pre>

<p>
To disable THP at run time
echo never &gt; /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled ⇐ command from web page
</p>
<pre class="code">echo &quot;never&quot; | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled </pre>

<p>
echo never &gt; /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag ⇐ command from web page
</p>
<pre class="code">echo &quot;never&quot; | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag</pre>

The following link is referenced if the above solution does not resolve the issue.

</p>

<p>
Create a customized tuned profile with disabled THP
The tuned-adm   command is not present on the servers
tuned-adm  active   following the documentation on the link I looked for the /etc/tune-profiles directory. 
No servers have the  /etc/tune-profiles/ directory → no need to follow this process.
