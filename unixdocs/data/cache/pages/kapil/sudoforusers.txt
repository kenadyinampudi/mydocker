====== SUDO Documentation for Users ======

sudo or as I call it "Super User Do" is a unix program that allows non-privileged users to execute some commands as root. sudo provides a rich set of features including monitoring, managing and alerting as compared to its competitors like setuid, proprietory RBAC or root equivalent user. 

At Tenneco, we have identified the following teams as the ones who will need to run some programs as root.

  * DBA Team
  * Data preservation Team
  * SAP - Basis Team
  * HP Openview Team.

We need to group servers

  * Production Servers
  * Non production servers
  * Backup servers
  * Others
===== Usage =====

  * This is the easiest part. This is as simple as "prefix the command that you need to run as root with sudo".<code>sudo /oracle/SID/11203/root.sh</code>The above command runs as root.
  * To list all the commands you are entitled to<code>sudo -l</code>
  * 

===== Dos & Don't(s) =====

  * There is no perfect security model. So there are ways around to break everything. So is sudo, there are ways around and the methods are easily accessible.
  * Be responsible. sudo gives great power on a Unix system. "With great power comes great responsibility, visibility and publicity". Think before you hit enter on that command that you prefixed with sudo. You are Superman !
  * Use sudo only when it really needed. It is not to be used for convenience. Do not fix a problem by "chmod 777" because you have the ability to do so for example.
  * When in doubt, use "CTRL + C" **do not hit enter**.

===== Limitations of sudo =====

  * Redirection is one limitation of sudo. i.e. <code>sudo echo "something" > /etc/motd</code>For security reasons, sudo does not permit re-directions. Instead, this works<code>echo "something" | sudo tee -a /etc/motd</code>
  * "cd" command i.e. <code>sudo cd /protected-directory</code>This will not work. Instead use<code>sudo ls -l /protected-directory</code>

===== sudo management =====

  * All sudo commands are logged and sent to a central repository. Unix team, from time to time , when required , will audit the file for investigation purpose and/or misuse.
