====== FileZilla Latest Version Connection Instructions ======

This is the screen capture from FileZilla V3.14.1 Windows Client that now requires TSL security if advertised by the FTP server.

To connect to Tenneco Servers, users who have this version will now need to set up individual site definitions for each server they wish to establish an ftp connection with.
On the main FileZilla Screen

Users will now have to go to File and then select Site Manager and set up the access for the particular server as shown below using ftp1.tenneco.com with user id customer as an example

In the example below I have created two folders, DMZ Servers, and Non DMZ servers. This is my own preference and for my own convenience.  You do not have to create folders.

Under each folder I have created example sites.  You will need to create a site for each server you wish to establish an FTP connection with. 

Below is the example for a simple connection with plain ftp. No security. This is equivalent to the default settings under FileZilla V3.9.0.6.  Note that the Protocol selected is FTP File Transfer Protocol and that the Encryption selected is Only use plain FTP (insecure).

Change the Logon Type to Normal as shown.  Enter the user name you want to connect to and the password.
To save the entry and connect to to the server click on the Connect button.   To save the entry and exit withour making a connection click on the OK button. This will close save your entry and return to the FileZilla main screen.
