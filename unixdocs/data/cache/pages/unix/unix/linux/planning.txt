====== Linux(RedHat) infrastructure at Tenneco ======

Tenneco at this time has some Linux systems. Some are Redhat, some CentOS, some are Ubuntu and SuSE.

==== Directions from upper management ====

** REDHAT IS THE TENNECO STANDARD FOR LINUX **

==== Considerations while deploying Linux ====

  * Only supported on Virtualized hardware. No new physical Linux deployement at this time.
    * Exceptions are the build servers itself.
  * No I/O intensive workloads to be deployed ( VMWare )
  * Typically the application can be on Linux while the databases will run on AIX.

==== Warning ====

  * Never ever install locally compiled / internet downloaded RPMs w/o consulting Unix team. We have a local redhat repository which has all RPMs that Redhat provides, if you need anything out of ordinary, please consult Unix team.
====== Redhat Infrastructure ======

    * Redhat installations are performed using kickstart.
    * We do not use PXE booting for obvious reasons (DMZ, the need for boot helpers in every subnet, complexity).
    * The redhat server gets defined on the Build server.
    * The build server creates a ISO , the client boots from it, pulls the configuration from build server.

=== Backup ===

  - OS backups ( Today OS backups are performed by VMWare snapshots - There is a inhouse project to make a mksysb equivalent undergoing)
  - Data backups (Netbackup agent/agentless)

=== Recovery ===

  - OS recovery (VMWare snapshots backed up on netbackup)
  - Data recovery ( Netbackup )

=== Patching ===

  * Will be done via the Local repository that serves patches.

=== Support ===

  * Redhat Support is paid for.
