Red Hat Enterprise Linux offers two primary MTAs: Postfix and Sendmail. Postfix is configured as the default MTA, although it is easy to switch the default MTA to Sendmail. 
To switch the default MTA to Sendmail, you can either uninstall Postfix or use the following command to switch to Sendmail: 
  
  yum install sendmail
  yum install sendmail-cf
  alternatives --config mta
  kill $(ps -ef | grep master | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
  
  /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S80sendmail start
  
The above commands will switch mail from postfix to sendmail.
