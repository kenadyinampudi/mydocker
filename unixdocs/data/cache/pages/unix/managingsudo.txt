====== Configuring sudo ======

  * Discuss and make sure what users ask for is legit.
  * Backup the master file.<code>sudo cp -p /prod/images/etc/sudoers /prod/images/etc/old/sudoers.$(date +%m%d%y%H%M)</code>
  * Edit the master file on pgnmsv01<code>sudo vi /prod/images/etc/sudoers</code>
  * Make the changes, copy the sudoers to a test system i.e. atlasdr, panmsv02 etc and test if the file is ok. If there is a typo, it will fail on syntax.
    * Push the file<code>sudo scp /prod/images/etc/sudoers panmsv02:/etc/sudoers</code>
    * Test it on panmsv02<code>ssh panmsv02</code>Test it<code>sudo su -</code>
  * Once tested, copy the file to all the systems. As root,<code>for host in $(cat /prod/images/etc/allhosts.tenneco)
do
   echo "Copying to ${host} .."
   sudo scp -o Batchmode=yes /prod/images/etc/sudoers ${host}:/etc/sudoers
done</code>Ignore the errors unless it is the server you want it to go.


As the sudo project did not go initially the way wanted it to go, we had to change the policies a little bit.

  * No more itocroot requests, we will not reset itocroot's password for any one.
  * The access will be given to an individual hence there is no need to share the password any more.
  * The access will not be given to extended period of time


** Enabling a user for sudo su - access **

No more sudo access here unless there is an exception.

  * Login to pgnmsv01 
  * Enable xxx user for yyy host<code>sudo /prod/images/scripts/manage_sudo enable xxx yyy</code>
