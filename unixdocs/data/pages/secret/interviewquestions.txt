  - In shell script, what does ''echo $?'' mean ?<code>Return code from the last executed command?</code>
  - In shell script, what does ''echo $$'' mean ?<code>Process id of the shell?</code>
  - What command or symbol is used to pass the STDOUT of a command to STDIN of another command?<code>pipe or "|"</code>
  - What are the differences between telnet and ssh<code>telnet transmits data in plan text versus ssh sends them encrypted.</code>
  - With respect to ''chmod'' command, explain 750<code>Read, Write and Execute permission to Owner of the object

No permission for other users.</code>
  - What command do you use to display last 10 lines of a text file?<code>tail -10 <filename></code>
  - What is the purpose of ''kill'' command?. Best answer<code>Kill command is used to send message to a running process</code>Acceptable answer<code>kill is used to terminate a process gracefully or abruptly -15 and -9 as arguments</code>
  - Explain ''nohup'' command<code>nohup command is used on child process to ignore terminal disconnects or termination of it's parent process, thus continues running in the background</code>
  - Hard links and soft links have the same inode number as the file to which it is linked. True or false<code>False.
Hard links have the same inode number as the original file.
Soft links have different inode number.</code>
  - Explain name resolution on a specific flavor of unix, let the candidate pick the flavor<code>nsswitch.conf or netsvc.conf
The order file,nis,bind
resolv.conf</code>
  - How do you find out the default gateway on a unix system.


===== Basic Questions - AIX specific =====

  - In AIX LVM, how do you rename a volume group<code>Unmount
varyoffvg
exportvg
importvg -y <newname> <pvid></code>
  - Why and how would you mirror rootvg in AIX?<code>Add the disk to rootvg
Execute mirrorvg
bosboot
bootlist</code>
  - Purpose and procedure of alt_disk_copy in AIX<code>To create a copy of the running rootvg on another disk
alt_disk_copy -d <diskname></code>
  - How do you display the configured network interface cards on an AIX system<code>ifconfig -a</code>
  - How do you find out the inode number of a file<code>ls -i <filename></code>
  - How do you list error entries on an AIX system<code>errpt</code>
  - How do you find out the memory on an AIX system<code>lsattr -El sys0 -a realmem
bootinfo -r
topas</code>
  - How do you check the paging space usage on AIX<code>lsps -a</code>
  - What is Logical Partition (LP) and Physical Partition(PP)<code>When a disk is added to a LVM volume group, it gets split into chunks depending on the size of PP.
A logical volume is created by a logical entity called LP. Each LP is mapped to one or more(mirrored) PPs</code>
  - A SAN disk has been added to an AIX system, Explain the steps to use that disk to expand a filesystem<code>cfgmgr
chdev -- allocate pvid, change algorithms if required
extendvg
chfs</code>
  - How do you NFS mount filesystem /test from serverA to serverB?<code>ServerA:-
Start NFSD
exportfs or /etc/exports # Add /test
ServerB:-
Start biod
mknfsmnt or make entries on /etc/filesystems
mount</code>


===== Basic Questions - Redhat specific =====

  - How to check IP addresses configured on a Redhat Linux system<code>ifconfig -a
ip a</code>
  - How to check the default route<code>netstat -rn
route -n</code>
  - How to list all the installed kernel modules?<code>lsmod</code>
  - What is the default operating system log file<code>/var/log/messages</code>
  - What is an inode ?<code>Inode has description of all files and pointers to the data blocks of files stored in it.
The information contained is file-size, access and modification time, permission and so on.</code>
  - What command is used to review boot messages?<code>dmesg</code>
  - Explain the procedure to extend an ext3/4 filesystem under LVM<code>lvextend 
resize2fs</code>


===== Advanced Questions - Unix generic =====

  - Explain the boot process of a unix system, Or explain the process from the moment you push the "ON" button of a unix system<code>Look for communication skills
Knowledge of operating system
BIOS -> MBR -> Boot image -> init -> rc -> runlevels -> Login</code>
  - What is a fork system call?<code>Create a new process from an existing process is called fork(). The main process is called parent process and new process id called child process.</code>
  - If you lose the "ls" command on a unix system, what other method will you use to list files or directories ?<code>echo *
find
du</code>
  - How do you delete a shell variable?<code>unset <variablename></code>
  - Explain an inode in a filesystem ?<code>Every object in a filesystem has an inode number. 
inode contains every attribute of the object except the name.
the map between inode and name is listed in the directory file.
inode contains File location on the disk, Size of the file, Device Id and Group Id, File mode information, File protection flags, Access privileges for owner, group, Timestamps for file creation, modifications, etc.</code>
