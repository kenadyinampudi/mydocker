Our new PC recycle vendor for North America is HOBI International.  We have a signed SOW and they are ready to start servicing Tenneco immediately in all of NA.  As with our old recycle provider, HOBI will bill Tenneco if there is anything due, and the facility will pickup the cost/profit.  You will also need to securely box the items on a skid for safe transporting.  The schedule a pickup of PC/Server hardware, simply use the provided link to initiate a request.  I have attached a copy of our agreement with HOBI in this email.  .
