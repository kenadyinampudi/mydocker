===== What we have to do to get CoD ? =====

  - Go to website https://www.ibm.com/servers/eserver/ess/index.wss
    - Sign in with your IBM ID (everyone has their own ID)
    - Select My entitled hardware
    - Select Elastic CoD - Download existing codes
    - Enter Machine Type Model and Machine Serial (for Power 9 server the Machine Type Model is 9040-MR9 and Machine Serial is 78AAECX)
    - Note code for PPAY - On/Off CoD Enablement Code for Processors  and MPAY - CoD Enablement Code for Memory
  - Go to HMC - phlypahmc007
    - Go to PHPVM022-9040-MR9-78AAECX
    - In General Settings on the left hand side select COD functions
    - Select Enter COD Codes
    - TCOD is Processor
    - TMOD is memory
  - During DR Test
    - Indicate how long before DR test COD should be executed. Preferably it should be executed as a part of the Test - at least couple of days
    - Execute steps 1 and 2 from procedure in case of real disaster
    - After the test deactivate COD

** When in doubt, ask **

{{:dr:whenindoubtask.jpg?400|}}

** Make sure you are on the DR host, not the production server ( don't do tickets in parallel / be extremly careful ) **

===== Prerequisites =====

**In this section provide what needs to be delivered by other teams**
  * DNS server is up and running - AD DCs -  Wintel 
  * NTP is up and running - Wintel and Network teams (either Infoblox or dedicated Linux NTP servers)
  * FDC VPN credentials are provided and PA GP VPN up and running - Network Team
  * LPAR capacity (RAM and Memory) is reduced - executed during the profile build  - Unix team - every server was build with 70% of capacity and COD must be activated. (Check COD document)
  * AIX Jump boxes: Unix team to deliver pcdcunxaxap01 and sfldmiax241   to be recovered with the top priority - DR Coordinator
  * SAN Storage to be provisioned (for AIX clusters, both nodes to be presented)
  * NIM server with mysysb images is up and running - Unix (in case recovery from backup would be required)
  * Mksysb images should be stored on NetBackup or Actifio - Data Preservation (in case recovery from backup would be required)
  * ISO AIX image needs to be stored at FDC - they are on NIM servers
