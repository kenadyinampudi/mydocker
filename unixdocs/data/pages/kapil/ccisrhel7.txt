<code>The hpsa driver has the following module option hpsa_allow_any=1.
This module option allows the use of PCI IDs that are not listed in the driver's 
pci-id table (recognition of Smart Array cards that are not tested/qualified with the hpsa driver).
To make the installer detect the controller at install time, 
pass the following hpsa.hpsa_allow_any=1 at the install prompt. Per the RHEL 7 release notes, 
any cards detected by using this option are not supported by Red Hat.</code>
