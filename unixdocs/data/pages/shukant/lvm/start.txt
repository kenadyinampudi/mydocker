====== Logical Volume Manager ( AIX ) ======

Volume Manager is a software / kernel extension to manage disk drives. LVM, aka 'Logical Volume Manager' is a generic name used by many operating system vendors such as IBM AIX, HPUX and Linux.

===== Logical Volume Manager Basics =====

Logical volume manager has the following components.

**Physical Volume (PV)**

A physical volume is a disk or a LUN (Logical Unit from a storage arrray ). It represents physical media where data can be written to.

**Volume Group(VG)**

A VG is a group of PVs.

**Physical Partitions(PP)**

  * As we add a PV to a VG, LVM slices the PV in to equally sized partitions called PP.

**Logical Volume(LV)**

  * A group of PPs make a Logical volume. PPs may not be from the same PV but they have to be from the same VG. 
  * LV can be used to create filesystems, paging spaces or system dump destinations. In some implementations, applications may use them raw.

**Logical Partition(LP)**

  * A logical volume is made of PPs. LP is a virtual pointer to one or more(mirroring) PPs.
  * On a regular LV, one LP is mapped to one PP.
  * On a mirrored LV, one LP is mapped to two or three PPs.

===== Logical Volume Manager Commands =====

  - List disks visible to AIX operating system<code>lsdev -Ccdisk</code>
  - List Physical volumes<code>lspv</code>
  - List volume groups<code>lsvg</code>
  - List logical volumes in a VG<code>lsvg -l <vgname></code>
  - Prepare a disk for LVM<code>sudo chdev -a pv=yes -l <hdiskXX></code>
  - Create a normal VG<code>sudo mkvg -y <vgname> -s <ppsize in MB> <hdiskXX, hdiskYY></code>
  - Create a Big VG(can accomodate 1024 PVs<code>sudo mkvg -B -y <vgname> -s <ppsize in MB> <hdiskXX, hdiskYY></code>
  - Create a LV
    - Unmirrored<code>sudo mklv -t <type> -y <lvname> <vg name> <number of LPs></code>
    - Mirrored<code>sudo mklv -c 2 -t <type> -y <lvname> <vg name> <number of LPs></code>
  - Create a filesystem
    - On a predefined Logical Volume<code>sudo crfs -vjfs2 -d <lv name> -A yes -t no -m <mountpoint></code>
    - AIX gives you a short cut to create the logical volume and filesystem in one step.<code>sudo crfs -vjfs2 -g <vg name> -A yes -t no -m <mountpoint> -a size=2048G</code>
  - Mount a filesystem<code>sudo mount <mount point></code>

** Mirroring **

Mirroring in simple words maps one LP to multiple PPs. 
Each PP contains a copy of data that is stored on the LP to which it is mapped to.
By now, you would have figured out we mirror logical volumes i.e. the LPs that makes the specific logical volume(LV).
