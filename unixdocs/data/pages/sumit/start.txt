====== This is my playground - don't take it seriously ======

===== Change IP address on AIX =====

  - Backup of the current configuration<code>sudo /usr/local/scripts/mksysb.sh adhoc</code>
  - Capture the current interfaces and corresponding IP addresses,<code>lscfg | grep ent
ifconfig -a
netstat -rn</code>
  - Change the IP address
  - Check and update /etc/hosts.
  - Shutdown the LPAR.
  - Login to HMC and change the VLAN on the NIC.
  - Ask the Wintel guy to change DNS
  - Startup the LPAR
  - Functional tests
    - ping the gateway
    - check ssh etc ......
    - nslookup both "A" record and "PTR" record.
  - Handover to apps guys to go ahead and test 

===== Backout plan =====

  - Change the bootlist to boot from alt disk.
