  * Frank will email you the new license as an attachment. Save the attachment to a local file on your PC
  * Use FileZilla to transfer file from local pc to pggpdb01. Transfer to your home  directory .  !!! NOTE MAKE SURE TRANSFER TYPE IS SET TO ASCII !!!!  Thsi removes all special characters like ^M from file. Newer versions of FileZilla do automatic sensing and transfer as required. 
  * You will need to coment out a line in /etc/inittab so make a copy of it now where yyyymmdd is current date <code> cd /etc </code><code> sudo cp -p inittab inittab-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S)</code>
  * Edit the the inittab file <code>sudo vi inittab </code>
  * Comment out the following line <and save the file. Note in the inittab a ":" is the comment character of choice, but a "#" will also work.  <code>flexlmtheorem:2:respawn:/opt/FLEXnet/cadverter/daemon_theorem start >/dev/null 2>&1 </code> 
  * Now tell the init command to re-examine the /etc/inittab file Note in AIX the telint and init commands are identical in purpose. See https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_61/com.ibm.aix.cmds5/telinit.htm <code> telinit q</code>
  * Change to the cadverter directory <code>cd /opt/FLEXnet/cadverter </code>
  * Save the current license as backup where yyyymmdd is current date <code>sudo cp -p license.lic license.lic-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S)</code>  
  * Copy the new licene <code>sudo cp -p {new license location} ./license.lic</code>
  * Copy the license.lic file to theorem.lic.<code> sudo cp -p license.lic theorem.lic</code>
  * Owner & group of theorem.lic should be root:system If they are not correct fix them now <code> chown root:system theorem.lic </code>
  * Change the permissions on the therom.lic file <code>sudo chmod 666 theorem.lic</code>
  * Invoke the new license <code>sudo ./lmutil lmreread -c ./license.lic</code>
