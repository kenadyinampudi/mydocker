====== alt_clone on mirrored rootvg Process Documentation ======

===== Introduction =====

This document outlines the process of performing an alternative cloning (alt_clone) operation in scenarios where maintaining the integrity of a mirrored rootvg is essential. The alt_clone procedure allows for the duplication of system configurations and data to an alternate disk without breaking the existing mirrored setup.

===== Prerequisites =====

Before proceeding with the alt_clone process, ensure the following:

**Server Reboot:** Confirm that the servers are scheduled for a reboot. This reboot can provide a clean starting point for the cloning process.

**Backup:** Perform a comprehensive backup of critical data to ensure data integrity and availability throughout the process.
===== Alternative Cloning Steps =====

**Unmirror rootvg:**
To initiate the alt_clone process, unmirror the rootvg volume group. This temporary step prepares the mirrored configuration for cloning.
<code>sudo unmirrorvg rootvg hdiskX
sudo reducevg rootvg hdiskX
sudo bootlist -m normal hdiskY</code>
**Perform alt_clone:**
Execute the alt_clone operation to duplicate the system configuration and data. This step involves creating a new disk image.
<code>sudo alt_disk_copy -B -d hdiskY</code>

**Mirror rootvg again:**
After successfully completing the alt_clone operation, re-establish the mirrored state of the rootvg volume group.
<code>sudo mirrorvg rootvg hdiskX</code>

===== Disk Space Consideration =====

It's important to ensure that sufficient disk space is available for the alt_clone operation. If the target disk space is insufficient, the operation will fail with an error message indicating the required disk space.
<code>taede651:/root>nohup alt_disk_copy -b -d hdisk3 hdisk5 &

Total disk space required is 235520 megabytes and target disk space is only 141312 megabytes.</code>
===== Innovative Approach =====

In cases where breaking the mirror is not an option due to operational requirements, an innovative approach involves creating an /image.data file using the mkszfile utility. This file defines the disk layout for the alt_clone operation. By modifying the /image.data file to adjust configurations such as LV_SOURCE_DISK_LIST, COPIES, and PP, you can tailor the alt_clone operation to specific disk requirements without breaking the mirror.

==== Procedure Summary ====

  * Create an /image.data file using **mkszfile** to define the disk layout.
  * Modify the /image.data file to adjust configurations. Below code snippet will help you do that.<code>cat /image.data | sed -e "s;COPIES= 2;COPIES= 1;g" -e "s;PP= 2;PP= 1;g" > /newimage.data</code> Or you can manually edit the files by changing the three lines<code>lv_data:
        VOLUME_GROUP= rootvg
        **LV_SOURCE_DISK_LIST= hdisk0 hdisk1  --> LV_SOURCE_DISK_LIST= hdisk0**
        LV_IDENTIFIER= 00f65ba700004c000000014d0fe343e5.3

        PERMISSION= read/write
        LV_STATE= opened/syncd
        WRITE_VERIFY= off
        PP_SIZE= 256
        SCHED_POLICY= parallel
        **PP= 2 --> PP= 1**
        BB_POLICY= relocatable

        STRIPE_SIZE=
        SERIALIZE_IO= no
        FS_TAG=
        DEV_SUBTYP=</code>
  * Execute the alt_clone process with the modified /image.data file using the -i flag.<code>#nohup alt_disk_copy -i /newimage.data -d hdiskY &

  * Monitor the process for any errors or warnings.
  * Validate the cloned system on the target disk.
===== Conclusion =====

The alt_clone process offers a versatile solution for duplicating system configurations and data while preserving the mirrored state of critical volumes. By following the outlined steps and considering disk space requirements, you can effectively implement alt_clone without compromising the integrity of your mirrored rootvg.
