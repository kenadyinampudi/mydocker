====== Defining Unix printers for PTA, FTA, PTB etc ======

** Naming standards for printers **

  * Tenneco standard printer DNS names are "7" characters long. like, KET5007. 
  * If you get a new printer request with less than "7" characters, please ask the requester to fix DNS.
  * We do have old printers with "4" or "5" letters - we got to live with the for now.

 ** Creating a printer **

  * Login to pcdcunxlxap03.
  * Run the menu<code>sudo /root/UPQMS</code>
  * Follow the menu to create printers - when in doubt, call Chris :)
