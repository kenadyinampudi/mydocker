  - These servers are not built as per the standard and disk /dev/sdb is used for OS installation, usually as per standard we use /dev/sda for OS and /dev/sdb for data to build NBU homemade appliance.
  - Also some portion of the OS (/boot partition) is on datavg disk /dev/sda and rest on /dev/sdb for these server. In case someone perform the refresh activity for these servers it will lead to the OS/Data corruption.
