====== AIX Migration from Version 7.1 to 7.2 ======

  - Create proper change controls and paper work, get approvals from business, get apps contacts to manage applications etc. As Chris says **The whole nine yards**
  - [[unix:backupconfig|Perform the configuration backup]]
  - Define the NIM client<code>sudo nim -o define -t standalone -a platform=chrp -a if1="find_net peerap09 0" -a netboot_kernel=mp peerap09</code>
  - Login to the respective NIM server (penmsv01. Note that pgnmsv01 must be used for all systems other than the systems in Interexion). Define a variable with the target servername.<code>export nimclient_to="taerm057"</code>Change the hostname accordingly.
  - Export the v7100-02-02 NFS EFixes from pgnmsv01<code>sudo exportfs -i /prod/images/service-packs/7100-02-02-1316-efixes</code>
  - Prepare the NIM environment for the migration<code>sudo nim -o bos_inst -a source=rte -a lpp_source=710TL02-02_lppsrc -a spot=710TL02-02_spot -a no_client_boot=yes -a accept_licenses=yes ${nimclient_to}</code>
    - For a system outside the Lincolnshire datacentre, do the following
      - [[unix:tweaknimforworl|Tweak the NIM to avoid cross atlantic NIM installation]]
      - Boot the server to SMS, setup to boot from the local server where we copied the lppsrc and spot.
    - For a system in the Lincolnshire datacentre, do the following
      - Boot the server to SMS, setup IPL and perform a NIM boot.
  - At this menu, change the language to the correct one. Set Option 5. "Selece Edition: to standard, and select the right disk Make sure you CHECK THE LANGUAGE Environment  (option 2) You should have checked this during the "Perform the configuration backup section"<code>                            Installation and Settings

>>> Choice[0]:</code>Ignore the error like this if installing a system outside of Lincolnshire<code>nim_rcmd: getaddrinfo: Hostname and service name not provided or found
0042-001 nimclient: processing error encountered on "master":
   0042-006 nimclient: (To_Master) rcmd Error 0</code>
  - The system reboots after the install. Check the oslevel<code>oslevel -s
7100-02-02-1316</code>
  - Restore the SSH host & root keys you should have saved in Step 2 "Perform the configuration backup"<code>sudo /tmp/Pre_Upgrade/aix_upgrade/./RUNIT ./copy-etcssh-keys.sh</code>
  - Check the SFTP line on ''/etc/ssh/sshd_config'' and fix it. It should be ''/usr/sbin/sftp-server'' instead of ''/usr/libexec/sftp-server''
  - Install any EFIXES on the lppsrc.<code>sudo mkdir -p /mnt/Efix ;sudo mount pgnmsv01:/prod/images/service-packs/7100-02-02-1316-efixes /mnt/Efix</code><code>cd /mnt/Efix/NFS-EFIX</code><code>./install.sh</code>
  - Rboot the server as rquired by the Efix installation<code>sudo shutdown -Fr</code>
  - After server reboots checkfor successfull Efix Installation<code>sudo emgr -P</code>Results should be <code>
PACKAGE                                                  INSTALLER   LABEL

  - For a system outside of the Lincolnshire datacentre do the following
    - Login to NIM server pgnmsv01, reset the NIM client and de-allocate all resources<code>nim -F -o reset taerm057
nim -o deallocate -a subclass=all {server you just upgraded}</code>
    - Login to the local server where we setup the temporary NFS server and unexport the filesystems<code>exportfs -u /prod/nim/resources/spot/710TL02-02_spot/usr
exportfs -u /prod/nim/resources/lppsrc/710TL02-02
exportfs -u /export/nim/scripts/{server you just upgraded}.script</code>
  - Login to the NIM server and perform a NIM client cleanup<code>sudo nim -F -o reset <hostname>
sudo nim -o deallocate -a subclass=all</code>
