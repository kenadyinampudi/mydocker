====== Booting RHEL6 in Rescue Mode ======
  - RHEL6 systems can be booted in rescue mode from the Installation media or the Boot ISO.  Both Installation media or the boot ISO can be downloaded from the Redhat Customer portal with a valid service contract.  The Boot ISO is typically a few hundred MBs while the Installation media is in GBs. Depending on the reason for recovery, the boot image can be chosen. However in most cases, the smaller one, boot ISO, will work
  - Attach the boot ISO as the Virtual Drive from the Physical server's console or from the Virtual Machine's console from Vcenter.
  - Power ON / reboot to start the boot.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux boot splash screen will appear, Scroll down to the option **Rescue installed system** from the menu screen, but **don't hit ENTER**, rather, press the **TAB** key
  - If you need to enable multipath at the time of boot, Go to the end of the line containing vmlinuz and key in **rescue mpath** & Press **ENTER**
  - Chose the Language & KeyBoard Type.  Networking doesn't have to be setup, so chose "NO"
  - In the next screen, press **CONTINUE** to find so that /mnt/sysimage can be mounted as chroot
  - Press OK in the next two screens
  - In the **SWITCH CONTEXT** screen, select the **Start Shell** option
  - Chroot to the detected OS mount point<code>chroot /mnt/sysimage</code>
