  * Mount the virtual media on iLO Virtual Media
    * **HP DL3***
      * Login to the iLO<code>ssh LAN@${shortname}rmb</code>Use the standard password for "LAN".
      * Mount the Media.  Replace ''HOSTNAME'' with the actual hostname you are building.
        * __MP/PS__<code>vm cdrom insert http://pcdcunxlxap01.driv.com/servers/HOSTNAME.iso
vm cdrom set connect</code>__OR__
        * __CA/PT__<code>vm cdrom insert http://pablsv02.amer.int.tenneco.com/servers/HOSTNAME.iso
vm cdrom set connect</code>

    * **DELL Power Edge**
      * Login to iDRAC<code>ssh root@$rac-{shortname}</code>
      * Disconnect any previous connections<code>racadm vmdisconnect</code>
      * Connect the media.  Replace ''HOSTNAME'' with the actual hostname you are building.
        * __MP/PS__<code>racadm remoteimage -c -l http://pcdcunxlxap01.driv.com/servers/HOSTNAME.iso</code>__OR__
        * __CA/PT__<code>racadm remoteimage -c -l http://pablsv02.amer.int.tenneco.com/servers/HOSTNAME.iso</code>
        * If you get an error in the racadm shell that the operations can't be performed, login to the iDRAC and make sure that the DNS is configured correctly in iDRAC settings.  
    * **Dell Power Edge Servers with PERC 750/755 Adapter**
      * PERC H750/755 Adapters have a particular problem with the LUN Numbering, which is described [[https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/perc-h755/perc11_ug/virtual-disk-numbering?guid=guid-3def7f06-fa45-401b-9757-9169a92fa24e&lang=en-us|here]]. This 'feature' results in the Unix operating systems detecting the LUNS created last as the first device and hence, the DATA raid volume has to be created first and then the OS volume **only** for this type of adapter.
        * First, verify what adapter we have<code>racadm storage get controllers -o -p name,status</code>
        * If the o/p shows H750/755 adapter, then confirm that the vdisks are created in the reverse order<code>racadm storage get vdisks -o -p layout,status</code>Sample O/p<code>racadm>>racadm storage get vdisks -o -p layout,status
Disk.Virtual.239:RAID.Slot.3-1
   Layout                           = Raid-6
   Status                           = Ok
Disk.Virtual.238:RAID.Slot.3-1
   Layout                           = Raid-1
   Status                           = Ok
racadm>></code> The disk with highest LUN ID - 239 is the disk which is created first and RAID1 with 238 is created last.  If not, then connect with the Wintel team and request them to implement the correct order for H750/755 Adapters.  
  * Login to the Remote Console ''https://HOSTNAMErmb'' --> Login with LAN --> Remote console (Virtual Console is available in the Dashboard on Dell Servers)
  * If starting Virtual console downloads a jlp file, the console is configured to open in java application and you won't be able to open it unless you have java installed.  In such case, Go to Configuration --> Virtual Console and change the plugin Type to **HTML5**
  * Power on the server ''Virtual Power''
  * When the system boots --> At the BIOS screen --> Press "F11" --> Select the Virtual CDROM to boot from --> Hit enter.
  * At the grub menu, it will display the HOSTNAME --> hit enter to start the installation.
