  - mksysb backups on AIX.<code>Master Copy               pgnmsv01:/prod/images/scripts/mksysb.sh
On each AIX server        /usr/local/scripts/mksysb.sh</code>CRON entry will be<code>20 23 * * 5 /usr/local/scripts/mksysb.sh 1>/dev/null 2>&1</code>
    - Scope :-
      * It's sole purpose is to generate it's own mksysb and ftp/scp/rsync to it's local repository
        *	Local repository for all systems in Lincolnshire is pgnmsv01 - the NIM server.
        *	Local repository for all the systems in Interexion will be the new NIM server "penmsv01". [ Right now some servers are going to taitc058 - not sure ].
        *	Local repository for all production atlas systems(055) will be the backup server (057) and vice versa.
      * The master copy of the script will be on pgnmsv01:/prod/images/scripts. **It will copy once a week to all the systems. Hence, any local changes will be overwritten in a weeks time.**
      * It does not do tape mksysbs (There has to be seperate cron jobs for this )
      * It does not make DR copies of mksysbs	(There has to be seperate cron jobs for this )
      * It does not backup VIOS at this time. (May be in future)
    - Testing to be done
      * No room for mksysb
      * mksysb errors out
      * gzip failure
      * scp failure
