====== LPARs moves from LDC to CDC/PTT -- Technical Steps ======

===== Pre-cutover tasks =====

  - Agree the list of lpars and get approval for down time - Jeff / PM
  - Define LPARs at PTT - CSI
    - Email the WWNs to PTT Team for zoning and Storage team for host definitions.
  - Perform zoning at PTT - PTT
  - [[san:ldc-cdc-ptt-mv-defhosts|Perform host definitions at PTT Pure]]
  - Create schedule for each day and time - CSI
  - Make sure hosts in scope has their data replicated. - CSI
  - [[san:ldc-cdc-ptt-disablenfs|Capture the state and disable NFS and create alt disk copy]]

===== Cut over plan =====

  - [[http://taitc212/cgi-bin/blackout/login.cgi|Enable blackout for servers]]
  - Shutdown applications on the Server list -- Check the worksheet.
  - Shutdown databases (if any ) on the Server list -- Check the worksheet.
  - [[san:ldc-cdc-ptt-mv-disablenfsandshutdown|Shutdown servers]]
  - [[san:ldc-cdc-ptt-mv-finalsync|Perform an adhoc replication, and provision storage at CDC/PTT]]
  - [[san:ldc-cdc-ptt-mv-movelpars|Start LPARs at CDC/PTT]]
  - Start databases on PTT LPARs
  - Start applications on PTT LPARs -- Remember licenses.
  - Email monitoring team that the systems have been moved.
  - Email Backup team ( Andy Hill, James Fort )
  - Rename the LPARs on tgprhmc6(LDC) to "-migrated-to-CDC-PTT"
===== Functional tests =====

  - Validate the cloned applications work as expected.

===== Backout plan =====

  - Shutdown applications on PTT lpars.
  - Shutdown databases on PTT lpars.
  - Shutdown servers PTT
  - Boot LPARs at LDC.

===== Cleanup / Post move tasks =====

  - Cleanup LPARs and storage at LDC.
  - For cloned systems, 
    - Stop  LDC     ->  DRIVE replication
    - Start CDC/PTT ->  DRIVE replication
