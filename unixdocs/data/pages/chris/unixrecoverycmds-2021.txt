===== Introduction =====

  - This Disaster Recovery is different from all others you have participated in. The is no IBM contact phone number for assistance and there is only one HMC phlypahmc007. https://phlypahmc007/hmc/connect
  - The HMC is what I call crippled.  It can only be used to boot LPARS. There are no Dynamic Functions. You can not increase/decrease memory, add adaptes  etc. All that needs to be done the old style - manually. Thisis because the HMC is connected to both the Frozen network at the D.R.site and the Live Production network so we canaccess it.
  - You won't have to build a Nim Server, or any server. They are all prebuilt and the disk, including the rootg will be presented to them by the storage team. They are all crash consistant copies
  - IBM Contact s through the VAR SIRIUS <code>Pradip Bhatt 847-903-3075 
Nancy Waller Office: 312-202-0851,  Cell: 773-490-7500
Marco Laudatri Cell 847-840-6000, Office 847-948-8018</code> 




===== What will IBM do ? =====

  - IBM should have provided Dan and/or Jeannine with the Capacity On Demand (COD) Keys for the D.R. System 
    * System Model: IBM,9040-MR9 
    * Machine Serial Number: 78AAECX
  - These would/should be in the updated D.R. Documents as the First thing you need to do. Enable the COD.

** When in doubt, ask **

** Make sure you are on the DR host, not the production server ( don't do tickets in parallel / be extremly careful ) **
