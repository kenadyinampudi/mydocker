I did some research and here is the process to disable the Transparent Huge Pages. All links are to Red Hat documentation on the subject and all steps are from those documents.

Issue  Disable Transparent Huge Pages on below servers 

TAITC490     RHEL6.6  
TAITC491     RHEL6.6    
TAROS492   RHEL6.6
TASHA493   RHEL6.6

First step  take a snapshot of the servers before making any changes . backout if needed

Steps to remediate issue from https://access.redhat.com/solutions/46111
To disable THP at boot time
Append the following to the kernel command line in grub.conf:
transparent_hugepage=never  
<code>sudo cp -p /boot/grub/grub.conf  </code>
<code>echo "transparent_hugepage=never"  | sudo tee -a  /boot/grub/grub.conf </code>

To disable THP at run time
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled <= command from web page
<code>echo "never" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled </code>

echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag <= command from web page
<code>echo "never" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/defrag</code> 


The following link is referenced if the above solution does not resolve the issue.

Create a customized tuned profile with disabled THP
The tuned-adm   command is not present on the servers
tuned-adm  active   following the documentation on the link I looked for the /etc/tune-profiles directory. 
No servers have the  /etc/tune-profiles/ directory -> no need to follow this process.
