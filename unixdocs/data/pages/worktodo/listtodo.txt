  - Implement a consolidated inventory of unix servers, model, ser number, storage, san allocated, used and location. We should use /var/adm/.information
  - Audit /etc/profile, /etc/environment, /root/.profile - change the "PATH" variable .
  - Remove sulog script - that is redundant as sudo rolled out.

    - Improve filesystem creation.
    - Simplify the script.
  - Eliminate the need for rsh for BCV backups. ( PTA TA2 ). Examine .rhosts for root on all servers.
  - Too many cron jobs on servers .... Standardize and remove the unwanted. Consolidate some of the housekeeping jobs.
  - Implement a documentation site on the Interexion data-centre and rsync the contents.
  - Document and display all physical servers and their network ports
  - Document all unix users and groups in one page and the command to re-create them if required.
  - Turn off sendmail from all servers.
  - taitc118 NIM server's network is kind of a mess. Fix it .

  - VIO server's /etc/profile is to be tuned.
  - Implement historical data display on Lpar documentation.
  - Implement the new UCRT summary page and new cfg2html. Write a new one using the allhosts file.
  - Write a lsdiskcfg equivalent to VIO networking configuration.

  - Write up patching procedure for Redhat - do it once.
  - Test the redhat upgrade process. - Use paavap02 - install with 6.2 and upgrade to 6.3 - This is not possible, find an alternative.
  - Research and integrate Bladecentres in HMC.
  - Migrate paitap01 -> paitap02 and move pablsv02 to the HS21 blade.
