====== Engineering Build Disk Configuration ======

This document was prepared during the build of pnbrenglxap0[1-4]

===== Hardware that was ordered =====

The server was ordered with 4 Hard disks.  2 of them were 900GB SSD Disks and another 2 SAS HDDs of 1.1TB each. <code>racadm>>racadm storage get pdisks

===== How is it configured =====
The SSD disks were configured in RAID1 to be used as root disks and the other disks were configured in individual RAID0 volumes.  __Remember to create the first ROOT RAID1 volume as the first virtual disk.  This could be different for different types of RAID controller.  This server had PERC H355 controller and hence ROOT Disk must be created first to get the lowest target ID__<code>racadm>>racadm storage get vdisks -o -p name,layout,size,mediatype,status

===== Why are they configured such? =====

  * ROOT disks needs redundancy and must be configured with some mirroring (either software or hardware) to ensure smooth operation and to avoid a single point of failure. 
  * DATA & SCRATCH disks could have been left outside of the RAID control and presented as straight RAW disks to the Operating system.  This option was ruled out because if we don't configure them as RAID disk, then they were getting a higher priority (lower) target ID than the root volume and the automatic installation process would start installing the OS to one of the bigger HDD disks. 
  * Why then DATA & SCRATCH not in a single RAID volume - The Engineering team needs two filesystems - /data & /scratch each of 1.1TB in size. If we configure DATA & SCRATCH in a single RAID volume, the OS will see it as one disk.  Creating a filesystem on top of a VG restricting the physical extents to just one disk is a bit tricky and there is a high probability that one disk failure could demand a rebuild of the whole RAID volume there by resulting in data loss for both filesystems. If we separate it in two different RAID volumes and two different volume groups, a single point of failure will only be limited to one filesystem.
