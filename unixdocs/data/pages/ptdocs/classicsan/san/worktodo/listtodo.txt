====== The done list ======

  * Upgrade TPC software
  * Firmware backout - Brocade -- Investigate and document.
  * Work on pgstap01 -- May be give it to Unix team
  * Develope a script that shows something like this<code>Hostname - Array Name - Total size allocated</code>
  * Investigate and document 'server_archive' command.
  * Better monitoring on VNX / Clariion
  * Run performance reports every month -- use mitrend ?
  * Fix LUN sizes @ Interexion.
  * Fix VNX zoning for rest of AIX / VIOS servers.
  * Create a form for storage allocation / reclamation.
  * Connect DMX4 opensystems to SAN.
    * Move IT0 to SAN ( Enable masking, connect to Fabric A & B - coordinate with Unix team to move from MMA to P740)
    * Move teprbk01 to SAN ( Enable masking, connect to Fabric A & B )
    * Move taprvio20/21 to SAN ( Enable masking, connect to Fabric A & B )
    * Move taprvio30/31 to SAN ( Enable masking, connect to Fabric A & B )
    * Move VIOS servers in the DMX4 SAN to Fabric A & B.
    * Add ISL links to DMX4 switches and integrate them to Fabric A & B.
    * Connect tepr2d01 and tapr1d01 through all 4 SAN switches.
  * Migrate Unisphere - VMAX to pablsv01.
  * Migrate hosts from NONPROD Pool to PROD POOL @ LDC VNX
  * Upgrade VMAX firmware.
  * Implement VCM backups for VMAX.
  * Upgrade DMX4 firmware.
  * Implement ESRS for VMAX and VNX. ( Secure VMs, install redhat , should be in the DMZ - Dirk has blessed it)
  * Move cables on Fabric A&B to sequence the ports.
  * Migrate storagedocs to pablsv01.
  * Document portloginshow on all switches.
  * Research an open source tool to document switch port utilization.

====== The cancelled list ======

  * Research and implement striped meta LUNs for mainframe. Migrate test and then prod lpars.
  *
