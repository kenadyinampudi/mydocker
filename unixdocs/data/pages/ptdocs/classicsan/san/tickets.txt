The messages are part of the NaviCimom restart process. It restarted normally, but the restart may have had something to do with the above errors. 
As per KB: 330427 , If there are no problems on the array, the messages can be ignored. I have analyzed the logs and confirm there is no issue.
This alert can be ignored. No action is necessary for this error. There are no array faults.</code>
