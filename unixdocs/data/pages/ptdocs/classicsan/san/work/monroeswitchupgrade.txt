====== Technical plan for Monroe SAN switch upgrades ======

  - Location of all firmwares on tamon055<code>/santeam/firmware-temporary/</code>
  - Upgrade path ''v6.3.2b --> v6.4.3d --> v7.0.2c --> v7.1.1c --> v7.2.1c''

===== Upgrade MONSANSW1 =====

  - Document and backup
    - Login as admin to monsansw1
    - Document the firmware version<code>firmwareshow</code>
    - Backup the config<code>configupload -all -p ftp 10.36.208.20,leejjose,/santeam/firmware-temporary/MONSANSW1.txt</code>
    - Verify the backup has been created.<code>ls -ld /santeam/firmware-temporary/MONSANSW1.txt</code>
  - Start the update process
    - Disable traffic through the switch<code>switchdisable</code>
    - Upgrade to 6.4.3d
      - Start the upgrade process<code>firmwaredownload -b -p ftp 10.36.208.20,leejjose,/santeam/firmware-temporary/v6.4.3d/</code>
      - Switch reboots, reconnect through ssh, check the firmware version<code>firmwareshow</code>
    - Upgrade to v7.0.2c
      - Start the upgrade process<code>firmwaredownload -b -p ftp 10.36.208.20,leejjose,/santeam/firmware-temporary/v7.0.2c/</code>
