====== Brocade upgrade - 2017 ======

 *Please Blackout all servers before upgrading the SAN switch*



===== Stage the Brocade upgrade files =====

  - For brocade switches at LDC or Interxion, ignore this step. The brocade software will be on pgunap01(LDC) or pgunap02(INX)
  - For systems outside LDC or Interexion ** Do this step a few days in advance **
    - Locate a unix system with enough space to stage the installation files<code>Edenkoben		taede057
Gliwice			taglw057
GrassLake		taglk057
Interxion		pgunap02
LDC			pgunap01
Monroe			tamon057
Rybnik			taryb055
St Truiden		tastr057
Seward                  tasew007</code>
    - Login to the Admin server<code>ssh pgunap01</code>Switch to sanmontr<code>sudo su - sanmontr</code>Just to make it easier, define the staging server as a variable<code>export stagesrvr=<corresponding stage server></code>
    - Check if the target system has enough space to stage the upgrade. We need 3G in /home. If there is not enough space Ask Unix team to make it temporarily bigger<code>ssh ${stagesrvr} df -k /home</code>
    - Create the brocade directory if it does not exist<code>ssh ${stagesrvr} "mkdir -p brocade"</code>
    - Start the rsync for v 7.4.1d<code>rsync -avv /prod/storageteam/soft/Brocade/v7.4.1d/v7.4.1d/ ${stagesrvr}:brocade/v7.4.1d/</code>
    




===== Upgrade to FOS 7.4.1d =====

  --Make a note of the IP address of the staging server<code>nslookup ${stagesrvr}</code>
  -Define a variable to the switch<code>export switch=<Switch Hostname></code>
  - Login to the switch<code>ssh admin@${switch}</code>
  - Upgrade the firmware
    - Interxion<code>firmwaredownload -p scp 10.56.13.92,sanmontr,/prod/storageteam/soft/Brocade/v7.4.1d/v7.4.1d</code>
    - Lincolnshire<code>firmwaredownload -p scp 10.32.6.150,sanmontr,/prod/storageteam/soft/Brocade/v7.4.1d/v7.4.1d</code>
    - Remote offices<code>firmwaredownload -p scp <stagesrvr IP>,sanmontr,/home/sanmontr/brocade/v7.4.1d</code>Change the IP address to the local stage server
  - You should see a message similar to this<code>Verifying if the public key authentication is available.Please wait ...Success.

Checking system settings for firmwaredownload...
WARNING: Fabric Watch is discontinued in FOS 7.4 and will not run after firmware upgrade. To continue with monitoring capability, 
it is recommended to migrate to MAPS prior to firmware upgrade. Users can convert existing Fabric Watch thresholds into MAPS policies by 
using "mapsConfig --fwconvert" CLI command and continue monitoring with the same settings. Fabric Watch thresholds cannot be converted to MAPS policies after firmware upgrade. 
Please refer to MAPS Administrator's Guide for further information.
System settings check passed.

You can run firmwaredownloadstatus to get the status
of this command.

This command will cause a warm/non-disruptive boot but will 
require that existing telnet, secure telnet or SSH sessions 
be restarted.
