====== Procedure to upgrade Monroe SAN switches from 7.4.0a to 7.4.1d ======

  - Login to the Admin server<code>ssh pgunap01</code>Switch to sanmontr<code>sudo su - sanmontr</code>Just to make it easier, define the staging server as a variable<code>export stagesrvr=tamon057</code>
  - Check if the target system has enough space to stage the upgrade. We need 3G in /home. If there is not enough space Ask Unix team to make it temporarily bigger<code>ssh ${stagesrvr} df -k /home</code>
  - Create the brocade directory if it does not exist<code>ssh ${stagesrvr} "mkdir -p brocade"</code>
  - Start the rsync for v 7.4.1d<code>rsync -avv /prod/storageteam/soft/Brocade/v7.4.1d/v7.4.1d/ ${stagesrvr}:brocade/v7.4.1d/</code>
====== Upgrade to FOS 7.4.1d ======

  -Make a note of the IP address of the staging server<code>nslookup ${stagesrvr}</code>
  -Define a variable to the switch<code>export switch=monds300a</code>Change this for the second switch
  -Login to the switch<code>ssh admin@${switch}</code>
  -Upgrade the firmware<code></code>Monroe<code>firmwaredownload -p scp 10.36.208.23,sanmontr,/home/sanmontr/brocade/v7.4.1d</code>
