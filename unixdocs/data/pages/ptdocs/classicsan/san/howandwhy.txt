====== Notes on stats ======

  * Most of the stats are produced by custom home grown shell scripts. 
  * Shell scripts run from server pgunap01 and pablsv01.
  * All the raw data is collected in<code>/prod/storageteam/dokuwiki/data/tennecodata</code>
  * For each graph here, there is,
    * A shell script that collects the raw data and inserts in to the text databases.
      * This shell script jumps to the Storage admin server ''pablsv01'' for the most part as it has the NAVICLI and SYMCLI to manage EMC arrays.
    * A shell script that process the data and create graphs.
      * Creating graphs here is no rocket science, I simply use Google's piechart function. So, yes , if google is down, the graphs will not work.
        * But as we have the raw data, when ample time is available, we should be able to write some coded to RRD plot the data.
