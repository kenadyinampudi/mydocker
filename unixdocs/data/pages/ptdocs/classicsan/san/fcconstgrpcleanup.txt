====== How to remove a V9000 snapshot that was made ======

  - Once the made snapshot becomes un-needed we should get rid of it. 
  - ** First thing to make sure is to double and tripple check that we are dealing with the correct consistency group,**
    - The customer no longer need the snapshot.
    - You have a documented email/ letter from the customer that the target disks / filesystems are no longer needed.
    - The target disks have been disconnected from hosts.
  - Below are steps I did in order to get rid of snapshot which was created for CORE SP upgrade:
  - Define a variable to the FlashCopy Group<code>export mapping=TA2CORESPBKP</code>
  - Stop the consistency group<code>ssh admin@ldcv9ac2vip1 stopfcconsistgrp ${mapping}</code>
  - Document the flashcopy tasks in the group<code>ssh admin@ldcv9ac2vip1 lsfcmap -filtervalue name=${mapping}* -nohdr > lsfcmap_${mapping}.txt</code>
  - Remove the flashcopy tasks<code>for i in `cat lsfcmap_${mapping}.txt|awk '{print $2}'`
do
   echo ssh admin@ldcv9ac2vip1 rmfcmap -force ${i}
done</code>Execute the commands.
  - Remove the consistency group<code>ssh admin@ldcv9ac2vip1 rmfcconsistgrp ${mapping}</code>
  - Remove the target LUNs<code>for i in `cat lsfcmap_${mapping}.txt|awk '{print $6}'`
do
   echo ssh admin@ldcv9ac2vip1 rmvdisk ${i}
done</code>Execute the resulting commands.
