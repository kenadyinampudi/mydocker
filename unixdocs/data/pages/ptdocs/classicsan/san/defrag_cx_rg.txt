====== Defragmenting Raid Groups on Clariion storage arrays. ======
\\ 
To be able to create LUNs raid group do need contigunous free space, if we will remove some LUNs from RG it can be defragmented.\\ 
To check if defrag is needed you can use GUI or CLI.\\ 
====== GUI steps are: ======

\\ 
Defragmenting compresses gaps on a RAID group that may have been caused by destroying and creating LUNs, and provides more contiguous free space across the disks.\\ 
\\ 
Follow the steps to Defragment a RAID group with Unisphere Manager:\\ 
\\ 
    Determine the amount of usable space on a RAID group.\\ 
    In the systems drop-down list on the menu bar, select a storage system.\\ 
    Select Storage > Storage Configuration > Storage Pools > RAID Groups.\\ 
    Open the RAID Group Properties dialog box by doing one of the following:\\ 
\\ 
    Double-click the RAID group icon that you want to defragment.\\ 
    Right-click the icon for the RAID group that you want to defragment, and select Properties.\\ 
    Select the RAID group that you want to defragment and click Properties.\\ 
\\ 
    Click Partitions.\\ 
    Click Defragment, and then click Yes to continue with the defragmentation.\\ 
    Click OK to close the dialog box.\\ 
\\ 
Notes 	Defragmentation is not supported on RAID 6 groups.\\ 
\\

====== CLI stpes are here ======
\\
''/nas/sbin/naviseccli -h spa getrg 10 -lusc -ucap \\ 
RaidGroup ID:                              10\\ 
Free contiguous group of unbound segments: 643565056\\ 
Free Capacity (Blocks,non-contiguous):     958137856\\ ''

If group is not fragmented the two above values will be equal, ie:\\ 
''/nas/sbin/naviseccli -h spa getrg 15 -lusc -ucap\\ 
RaidGroup ID:                              15\\ 
Free contiguous group of unbound segments: 2381763584\\
Free Capacity (Blocks,non-contiguous):     2381763584\\ ''

To start defrag execute this command\\ 
//naviseccli -h spa chgrg 10 -defrag\\ //
To check progress use this one\\ 
///nas/sbin/naviseccli -h spa getrg 10 -prcntdf\\ 
RaidGroup ID:                              10\\ 
Percent defragmented:                      46\\
