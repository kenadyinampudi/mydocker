====== Capture packets when scanners fail to create objects inside a NAS share from VNX ======

In some sites from time to time we do see that printer's scanners are unable to scan to UNC share which is hosted on EMC VNX.
If such issue will arise do the following:


  - Login to pgunap01<code>ssh pgunap01</code>
  - Copy this file<code>sudo -u sanmontr scp /prod/storageteam/sanmontr/utils/tcpdump_loop_v2_2p.sh nasadmin@edevnx5400cs0:</code>
  - Determine with server_df a file system with about 100GB of available storage.<code>server_df server_2  | grep -v "server_2:" |awk '{if(NF==1) {printf $0;getline;print $0} else print $0}'  | grep ^fs</code>i.e. Here it is /root_vdm_1/fs_050_data/tcpdump - folder tcpdump was created there by executing as root.
    - Switch to root<code>su -</code>Create the directory<code>mkdir /nas/quota/slot_2/root_vdm_1/fs_050_data/tcpdump</code>
  - Run this command against IP of example library where scanning is not working - have someone locally to try to scan from this printer/scanner<code>./tcpdump_loop_v2_2p.sh server_2 -start fsn0 -w /root_vdm_1/fs_050_data/tcpdump -host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxxx -t 50000 -n 30</code>
  - If sniffing for this IP (printer/scanner) will not give any output run the following<code>./tcpdump_loop_v2_2p.sh server_2 -start fsn0 -w /root_vdm_1/fs_050_data/tcpdump -t 50000 -n 30</code>
  - Create yet another folder<code>mkdir /nas/var/dump/SMBlog</code>
  - Copy this {{:san:logrotate.zip|script}} to /nas/var/dump/SMBlog, unzip it there and run it every 5 mins via crontab<code>pscp logrotate.zip nasadmin@rybvnx5400cs:./
unzip logrotate.zip
cat logrotate.sh |sed "s/^M//" > /nas/var/dump/logrotate.sh
chmod +x /nas/var/dump/logrotate.sh
mkdir /nas/var/dump/SMBlog
crontab -e
*/5 * * * * /nas/var/dump/logrotate.sh</code>
  - Open case with EMC and feed CE with these details - outcomes from tcpdump_loop_v2_2p.sh and these logrotate.sh
  - Once done with trouble shooting - remove crontab entry, delete tcpdumps, and logrotate outcomes.
