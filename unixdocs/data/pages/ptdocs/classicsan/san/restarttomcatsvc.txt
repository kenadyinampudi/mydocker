====== How to fix V9000 GUI when it is broke ======

===== Brief Introduction on V9000 architecture =====

  - **Most importantly -- ALWAYS OPEN A PMR with IBM before you proceed with this step**
  - The V9000 consists of the following components
    - SVC Node 1
    - SVC Node 2
    - Pair of fibre channel switches
    - A Flash 900 array
  - SVC nodes are connected to the Flash 900 storage through the dedicated pair of SAN switches.
  - The SVC nodes are then connected and zoned to our Core Fabric A & B.
  - SVC nodes also run the management software as a cluster. Node 1 is primary and Node 2 is failover.
    - In our setup,
      * Node1 is ldcv9ac2n1
      * Node2 is ldcv9ac2n2
      * The cluster IP address is ldcv9ac2vip1
  - Ideally a tomcat server runs and deliver the V9000 GUI on Node1 through the Virtual IP address ( ldcv9ac2vip1 )

===== How to fix it =====

==== The GUI way ====

  - Login to the node directly i.e. Try logging into Node2 as Node1 is probably failed it's tomcat.
  - Once logged in as superuser, 
    - Select the Node1
      - Select Restart service on the left hand side panel.
        - Select tomcat -- restart

==== The CLI way ====

  - Login to the VIP<code>ssh superuser@ldcv9ac2vip1</code>
  - Restart tomcat<code>satask restartservice -service tomcat</code>
  - It takes about 5-10 minutes...
