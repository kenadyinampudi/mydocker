==== Add new server (asset) to NLyte ====
  * Click on "Home" button
  * Click the picture of the type of asset.  Usually this would be a server. \\ For example, click "Server Standard"
  * A "Create Asset" dialog box will pop up.
  * Search for the type of server.  \\ To make finding a server easier, use the search. \\ Type in the Manufacturer name and star to filter the list, for example "Dell PowerEdge*"
  * Click the appropriate model and click **Next**
  * In the next "Details" screen, fill in the server name under **Name**.
  * Set **Operational Status** to "Procurement"
  * Optionally, fill in the **Tag** if known.  (I use the serial number here)
  * Optionally, fill in the **Serial Number** if known. (I double enter the serial here)
  * Click **Next**
  * In the next "Location" screen, find and click the location where the asset will be located.
  * The asset will be created and you will be brought to the asset screen.

==== Finish the Server ====
At this point, you have an unmounted and planned server.  It will not show up in any rack and will not show up on most reports. It needs to be completed.
  * Click the dark colored **Actions** menu button and select "Complete Record" to indicate the server is purchased and delivered, not just planned.
  * Click the dark colored **Actions** menu button and select "Mount in Cabinet"
  * In the next "Search Results" dialog box, select the rack for the server.
  * Click the highlighted **Confirm Move** button to add the server to the rack
  * Click **Yes** to any warning dialog boxes.  \\ The warnings are meant to ensure you don't violate any datacenter rules.  We do not have any valid datacenter rules, so all these warnings are invalid.
  * At the top of the asset screen near the **Action** menu button, click the 3d picture of the rack to be taken to the rack.
  * In the next "Cabinet View" screen, click the **Assets** tab on the top left side.  \\ This shows all unmounted assets.
  * Click and drag the new asset you created to the approriate location in the rack
