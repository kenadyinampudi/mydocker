===== VSFTP =====

This is one of a couple of different FTP services we use.
The main config file is at /etc/vsftp.conf\\
\\
/etc/ftpusers is a list of "deny" users.\\
The main security access is maintained with /etc/pam.d/vsftpd.\\

=== PROBLEMS ===
  * One problem I ran across was ssh would work with HPCC systems but not ftp.  The issue was with the pam_shells.so directive which requires a valid shell for a user to proceed.  AD authenticated users don't have a defined shell, so this part was failing.  I removed the requirement for a valid shell and both authentication and the deny list worked correctly.
