====== Writing your own service for System-D ======
To use systemd to start and stop services in a newer system (and to enable it to start at runtime) do the following :\\ 
\\ 

  * Stick all your commands in a single script file and save it somewhere only root has access.\\  ''vi /usr/sbin/myservice.sh''
  * Make sure that script is executable.\\ ''chmod +x /usr/sbin/myservice.sh''
  * Create /etc/systemd/system/<name>.service\\ ''touch /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service''
  * Edit the new service file with appropriate details. \\ <code>
[Unit]
Description=MyService

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/myservice.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code>
  * Test starting the service. \\ <code>
systemctl start myservice; systemctl status myservice </code>
  * If all is well, enable it for startup (if desired).\\ ''systemctl enable myservice''
