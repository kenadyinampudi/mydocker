They will ask you for your authorization number for either site is: 19303A
They will ask you for what service you will need. Tell them you need a 'critical recall of tapes within 3-4 hours.
They will ask you what tapes are needed. Tell them how many tapes and barcode numbers for each. Understand that you must state them as they are listed in the IM vault reports. In other words you will need to the the suffix of 'L4 or L6'.
They will look up each tape to verify that they are vaulted with them..
Once they have all that is needed be sure to get a confirmation #.
Be sure to notify someone at LDC that tapes will have to picked and handled from the front desk to loading them in the tape library


The second method is to email IM. 
'request@ironmountain.com'
In the body of your email first type in your name, the company you work for, your siteaccount #, your authorization #, your contact phone # and name off the site you are requesting for. Add to this that you want a 'critical recall of tapes to be delivered in the next 3-4 hours'. Enter the tapes as they appear at IM (example LDC435L6) and send.
You will get a email response that IM received your request and that your request is being processed.

**DO NOT SEND any emergency request via the web interface as they will be rejected.** A direct call or direct email are the only two methods.
For general, next day returns of tapes needed for restores. The web interface (recommended) or email request next day delivery will do. You can also call but be sure to note that this can be for next day scheduled delivery.
