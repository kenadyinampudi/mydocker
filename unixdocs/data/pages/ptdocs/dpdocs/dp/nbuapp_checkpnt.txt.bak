Some EEBs do recommend to create a manual/user checkpoint, ie:<code> >> CAUTION: Before you install this EEB, Veritas recommends that you create a custom appliance checkpoint using the Support > Checkpoint Create command. Are you sure that you want to proceed with the EEB installation? [yes,no]</code> - in order to quickly revert back to the state prior EEB installation. Please take a few momenets to see how this can be done. 
If you will find your self in position to revert back to a certain checkpoint always get in touch with Pawel and/or VRTS support in order to check what consequences it might have.
Login to an appliance, Stop NetBackup from main menu of CLISH goto support/processes and execute NetBackup stop<code>glwnbu5230ams.Processes> NetBackup Stop

Creating an Appliance Checkpoint allows the user to easily rollback the entire system back to a point-in-time to undo any misconfiguration or system failure that might have occurred. An Appliance Checkpoint captures the following components:
        1) Appliance Operating System
        2) Appliance Software
        3) NetBackup Software
        4) Networking Configuration
        5) Any previously applied patches
        6) Backup data is not reverted
