Recently on one of my site, the NetBackup jobID values are resetted automatically ( eg: from 4900 to 0)
This can cause irregularities in reporting. Then I have searched and found the way to reset back again 

On Windows based servers :
  - NBU services to be stopped during this change to ensure that new jobs will use the edited jobid file.
  - Go to E:\Program Files\Veritas\NetBackup\db\jobs at windows based server.
  - Open the job ID file with notepad.
  - Edit the value in the jobid file to a value larger than the last known job ID.
  - Start the NBU services and test one job

On Linux/Unix based servers :
  - NBU services needs to be stopped.
  - On UNIX and Linux, the jobid file can be found in the /usr/openv/netbackup/db/jobs  directory.
Open the file and change the values(to a value larger than the last known job ID) accordingly.
