If MS-SQL DB is running in a VM for which we do already run VMWARE based backups we can enable DB recovery from such backups. In order to do so we need to do few things:
  - NBU client server should be running on doamin\svcbackup user - you do it during NBU client installation - it is required for such VM.
  - Above user has to belong to Administrators group.
  - Above user needs to be granted with sysadmin role within this SQL server - DBA can do it for you.
  - Above user must have the provileges to Impersonate a client after authentication and Replace a proces level token - use secpol to add these.
  - On VMWARE policy in VMware tab in section Application Protection tick the check box for Enable SQL Server Recovery
By doing all above, after such VMWARE based backup on client we can start up NBU SQL Client software and restore SQL DB if need will be.
