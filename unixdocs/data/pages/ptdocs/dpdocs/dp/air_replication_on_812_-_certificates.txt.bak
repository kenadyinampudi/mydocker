Configuring CA and certificate for secure communication between the source MSDP storage server and the target MSDP storage server
MSDP now supports secure communications between two media servers from two different NetBackup domains. The secure communication is set up when you run Auto Image Replication (A.I.R.). The two media servers must use the same CA to do the certificate security check. The source MSDP server uses the CA of the target NetBackup domain and the certificate that is authorized by the target NetBackup domain. You must manually deploy CA and the certificate on the source MSDP server before using Auto Image Replication.
Note:
After you upgrade to NetBackup 8.1.2, manually deploy CA and the certificate on the source MSDP server to use the existing Auto Image Replication.
To configure the CA and certificate, complete the following steps:
On the both NetBackup master servers, run the following command to display the CA fingerprint:
Windows:
<code>install_path\NetBackup\bin\nbcertcmd -displayCACertDetail</code>
UNIX
<code>/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -displayCACertDetail</code>
On the source MSDP storage server, run the following command to get CA from target NetBackup master server:
Windows
<code>install_path\NetBackup\bin\nbcertcmd -getCACertificate -server target_master_server</code>
UNIX
<code>/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -getCACertificate -server target_master_server</code>
When you accept the CA, ensure that the CA fingerprint is the same as displayed in the previous step.
On the source MSDP storage server, run the following command to get a certificate generated by target NetBackup master server:
Windows
<code>install_path\NetBackup\bin\nbcertcmd -getCertificate -server target_master_server -token token_string</code>
UNIX
<code>/usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -getCertificate -server target_master_server -token token_string</code>
Use either of these two methods to obtain the authorization tokens:
NetBackup Administration Console
Log on the target NetBackup master server and open Security Management > Certificate Management > Token Management.
Click the Create Token option to create a token, or right-click the blank area of the Token records list view and select the New Token menu item to create a token.
NetBackup Commands
Use the bpnbat command to log on the target NetBackup master server.
Use the nbcertcmd command to get the authorization tokens.
For more information on the commands, refer to the NetBackup Commands Reference Guide.
