If by any chance you will have to sort out issues with a client on CDC NBU domain - that the user initiated backups aren't successful, please check the following:
  * What is the client name for certificate in pane: Security Management/Certificate Management - if its not having bck suffix follow this procedure, on master run <code>sudo nbcertcmd -revokecertificate -host client_name_fqdn
sudo nbcertcmd -createToken -reissue  -host client_name_fqdn -name client_name_short_BCK</code> From this second command copy the token which was generated. Login to the client itself via SSH and run this<code>sudo /usr/openv/netbackup/bin/nbcertcmd -getcertificate -token token_from_prev_command</code>Below is example execution<code>pawetkac on pcdcbkplxms01:/home/pawetkac/script $ sudo nbcertcmd -revokecertificate -host qcdcqsnaxdb01.driv.com

Certificate revoke request processed successfully.
