  - Get rid of some of LTO4 tape drives (out of 8 give away 6, to still be able to read lto2,3,4 data) in TS3500 and possibly replace with LTO7 (2-4);
  - Check what can be done with FC switches in terms of refresh HW currently used with tape environment at LDC 
  - PE1 (NBU5240 14TB), JOH (NBU5240 4TB) and BXL HQ (NBU5240 14TB) needs to have local NBU appliances to have backups available on site.
  - Replace in EDE LTO4 tape drives to LTO6 (the best with library chassis - as this one is 8+ years old) - to minimize number of stored tapes.
  - Replace in STR LTO4 tape drives to LTO6 
  - Replace in INX LTO4 tape drives to LTO6 (the best with library chassis - as this one is 8+ years old) - to minimize number of stored tapes.
