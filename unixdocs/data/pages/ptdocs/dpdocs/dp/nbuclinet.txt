====== **NetBackup 8.1.2 client software installation** ======

To check if NBU client binaries are present on this given client, please login to master server and execute the following:<code>root on munnbuhmams:/root $ bpgetconfig -s tamun008.emea.int.tenneco.com
Client of munnbuhmams
PC-x64, WindowsXP
8.1.0
NetBackup
8.1.1
810000
C:\Program Files\Veritas\NetBackup\bin
Windows2012_R2 6</code>If you have similar outcome it means client binaries are installed and running. If you will receive this <code>root on mognbuhmams:/root $ bpgetconfig -s tamog002.amer.int.tenneco.com
cannot connect on socket</code> - it means client binaries are not running and/or are not running and not being installed. so please login into given client. Collect NBU binaries from nearest site - most likely from master server and install these there. In worst case scenario please download appropriate version from \\taitc138\f$\Veritas\ to this client. On home made master server binaries for wintel are being stored in: /inst/shared <code>root on mognbuhmams:/inst/shared $ ls -la

I will use this version to install it on example client tamog008.
First thing first - please copy pscp to this client tamog008 from this web site https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html or here is [[https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/pscp.exe|pscp-64bit]] or [[https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/pscp.exe|pscp - 32bit]] Once pscp is on the client open cmd prompt and go the folder with pscp.exe file: <code>C:\Users\q1pawetk>cd Downloads

For brand new clients (NBU domain is not aware of any backups of it etc) you need to generate token and provide it in installation. To create token do this:
{{ :dp:new_token.png?direct |}}
{{ :dp:token_creation.png?direct |}}
{{ :dp:token_created.png?direct |}}
Once installed you can see such output from this<code>root on mognbuhmams:/root $ bpgetconfig -s tamog002.amer.int.tenneco.com
