====== Adding a Host to Pure via Command Line ======

Steps to add a host to a Pure array via the command line.

==== Get your data ====
You need:
  * Host Name
  * WWNs

==== Add the host to Pure ====
   purehost create HOST...

This is just a create.  The default name won't really work, because there are no WWNs associated yet.
==== Modify host for usage ====
  purehost setattr --addwwnlist WWN-LIST --personality PERSONALITY HOST
This is a two-fer.  It adds WWNs to the host and sets the "personality" to enable the right set of SCSI commands.\\
"WWN-LIST" is comma-separated list of one or more Fibre Channel worldwide names (WWNs), no ":" or "." separating the values.
\\
Valid personalities are:
  * aix
  * esxi
  * hitachi-vsp
  * hpux
  * oracle-vm-server
  * solaris
  * vms
We almost exclusively use "aix" and "esxi".  "vms" is for directly connecting disk to a VM, not for presenting disk to the VM Host.
\\
==== Add host to hostgroup ====
This assigns all the disk assigned with a group to this host.  A host can only be in one group, so the host groups mirror the VM Clusters.
  purehgroup setattr --addhostlist HOST-LIST HGROUP
"Host-List" is a comma separated list of additional hosts.  It won't overwrite.
"HGROUP" is the VM Cluster name.

==== Add some disk ====
