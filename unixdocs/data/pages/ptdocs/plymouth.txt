# Plymouth UCS environment

## UCS Location

[UCS manager](https://10.84.102.10) [^1]

## Config notes

### Security
I created the standard set of user account groups: [^2]
* UCS Admins
* UCS LAN
* UCS SAN

## Storage
Storage is a bit of challenge.
I think the biggest issue was figuring out how to get the iSCSI network to work.
The key is making sure there's a proper VLAN available.

!!! note "Proper VLAN is a VLAN which exists on the upstream switches"

Yeah, good luck with that.  So I stole an existing VLAN 103 and put different IP ranges in it.
Since VLANs are just a segmentation of the network, there's nothing technically incorrect about putting different IP ranges into the same VLAN.
It does mean that the non-standard IP ranges are not routable, because the networking team only put one gateway into the VLAN.

Since all the traffic should be more or less local, no gateway is needed, therefore I should be able to get away with this without angering any networking gods.

### HDS HUS110 [^3]
To get this configured, I set the VLAN on the HDS ports.
The UCS ports were configured as trunks, passing the VLAN tags generated by the HUS directly into the switching environment.
The Dell Equallogic switching environment doesn't understand the concept of VLAN tagging, so I had to configure the uplink port as an access port so all the packets to and from that port get tagged as VLAN 103.

### Dell Equallogic
This is a dumb iSCSI device.  It's managed by a simple interface available to the MS team.
There's not a lot of capability inherent in it beyond disk.

## Port Configuration
On the UCS MINI, each fabric interconnect has only (4) 10GB ports.  (There's a 40GB port, but it's only used for daisy-chaining UCS chassis.)
The port usage is mirrored between the two 6324 FIs:

1. Uplink to HDS HUS110
2. Uplink to old SAN switches
3. Unused
4. Uplink to production network



## ToDo
[^1]: Make sure this gets added into InfoBlox
[^2]: Probably need to create a read-only group for local guys (AKA Anthony)
[^3]: Manage this at [http://sfldmilx200:22015/DeviceManager/](http://sfldmilx200:22015/DeviceManager/).  You'll need a login from the storage team.
