====== Checklist for New CDC Server ======


===== Pre-change control physical requirement verification =====

  - Verify new device is rack mountable
  - Verify size of new device
  - Verify power requirements of new device
    - The CDC uses 10Amp 220 circuits with C13-C14 receptacles.
    - Anything else will probably need to be verified directly with CTL
  - Get Rack Space, RU number from NLyte
    -   Matt Berg can help with this.
    -   Both rack number and elevation RU number are needed.
  - Identify how many FC SAN links will be needed.
  - Contact SAN team to determine where links will need to go.
    -   Include rack location, device and port of source and destination
  - Calculate length of FC OM3 cables needed to patch device into the end of row SAN patch panels
  - Identify how many 10GB Ethernet links will be needed.
  - Identify how many 1GB copper links will be needed.
    -   Include all management/DRAC links as well as regular connectivity
  - Contact LAN/WAN team to determine Ethernet link locations
    -   Include rack location, device and port of source and destination
  - Calculate length of 10GB OM3 cables needed to patch device into the end of row LAN patch panels
  - Calculate length of CAT6 copper cables needed to patch device. It’s usually the nearest Cisco 2K switch.

==== Pre-change control logical requirements actions ====

  - Put in placeholder in NLyte to indicate device location once installed.
  - Order any cables needed for the server.
    -   There may or may not be appropriate cables onsite in CDC.
    -   Make sure if a patch panel is being used that 2 cables are ordered for each link, one for the server side of the patch panel and one for the switch side of the patch panel.
  - Put in ticket to SAN team (if necessary) to identify and provision ports identified above
  - Put in ticket to LAN team to get IP addresses and device names
  - Put in ticket to LAN team to identify and provision ports identified above.
  -   Write up a PCF document for new device.
  - Draft change control
    -   Attach PCF
    -   Attach any required special permissions
    -   Use a ping as verification device is installed
    -   Can also use an application screenshot in addition if necessary for clarity
  -    Submit CC for review

===== Post-change control approval =====

  - If equipment is not arriving the day of (or day before) installation or if the equipment is arriving out of business hours, ask Operations to submit a ticket to receive the equipment.
    -   They will need a tracking number, carrier company, the addressee name

==== CenturyLink installation ====


  - Put in ticket with CTL to rack the device on the installation date.
    -   Include the rack and RU numbers.
    -   Include wiring instructions
        -   Include source port on new device and destination rack, device and port for each cable
    -   Include the instructions to check for link lights on the server after powering up
    -   Include phone number also so you can be directly reached if necessary.
  - Contact LAN and SAN teams to verify the new device is visible on the respective switches

==== Vendor Engineer Installation ====

  - Put in ticket with CTL to run cables prior to the installation date.
    -   Title this “Cable survey / installation”
    -   Include source port on new device and destination rack, device and port for each cable
    -   Include phone number also so you can be directly reached if necessary.
  -   Get Vendor engineer name and phone number for access to the CDC.
    -   Make sure the name given matches the name on the driver’s license exactly.
  - Have Operations submit a ticket to allow access for the engineer to the CDC on the installation date (or dates.)
  - Warn engineer that no cardboard is allowed on the floor, so he/she will need to unpack the equipment in shipping. CTL can provide carts for transport.
  - After the device is installed, have engineer power up the device and verify link lights are visible on device.
  - Contact LAN and SAN teams to verify the new device is visible on the respective switches.
  - Have vendor engineer finish installation.

===== Post-installation =====

  -   Gather proof for change control.
      -   Make sure to gather and document exactly what was written in the change control.
  -   Close the change control, attaching proof of completion.
  -   Finish whatever configuration or setup needs to take place.
