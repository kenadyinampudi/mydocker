====== Installing Veeam from Scratch ======
===== STEP 0 PREP WORK =====
  * Server needs to have all the backup storage already attached to it
  * An IPM exception needs to be put in to have the sfld-veeamadmin account made a local administrator of the machine
  * The PT-Linux group needs to have remote desktop login to the server for configuration
===== STEP 1 INSTALL VEEAM =====
  * Copy the Veeam base install package over.
  * Copy the CD over to the destination location
  * \\cdcpilms401.fedmog.federalmogul.com\d$\VeeamCD\VeeamBackup&Replication_9.5.4.2753.Update4a.iso
  * Mount the CD somewhere.  (Windows will usually automatically mount it as a separate drive letter.)
  * Run the "setup.exe"
  * Click "Install" in any of the locations.\\ 
<code>It will ask for a license file.  Skip this for the time being.
It will roll through and check the requirements.</code>
  * If any requirements are missing, click "Install" to fill in any missing items.\\ 
<code>  Click next and agree to the database upgrade.
  When it's ready to install, click the "Update remote components automatically", as there no remote components yet.
  When it's complete, it will say so.</code>
  * Close the installer and start up the console.
  You should notice the console has changed from a light green to more of a darker green.

===== STEP 2 ATTACH IT TO MS401 =====
  * Open a webpage to https://cdcpilms401.fedmog.federalmogul.com:9443/Configuration.aspx#!configuration/backup_servers
  * From the dashboard, click on the "Configuration" gear in the top right corner.
  * Make sure "Backup servers" are selected in the left hand menu
  * Click "+ Add" button in the top of the middle section.
  * In the pop-up dialog box, enter the name of the server you've just installed Veeam into, along with the veeam backup user name
  * After clicking OK, the main server at CDCPILMS401 will attempt to contact the remote server and add the licensing.
  * At this point, the server is properly licensed and yet independent.  
	  Note ... it will take a few minutes for the process to complete.  Your login window may timeout before the process is complete.  This is OK.

===== STEP 3 CONFIGURATION OF REPLICATION, BACKUPS AND WHATNOT =====
  * Turn over to the Backup team for final configuration
