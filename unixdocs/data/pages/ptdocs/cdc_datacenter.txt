Our datacenter is at 2425 Busse Rd, Elk Grove Village, IL 60007.  There’s no identification of any kind on the building.  You can spot the big heat exchangers on the roof though.  Parking is in the rear of the building.  \\

Sign at the main entrance with the guard.  You need to have the ticket generated before you are granted access.  Allow 15-20 minutes for the checkin.\\
Tell them you are with Tenneco/Federal-Mogul.  Ask if someone from the NOC can show you to the cage.  It can be difficult to get to the exact place. \\

Important equipment is locked in the drawers at the end of the rows.  The key is in the unlocked drawer at the end of Row 1.08.
Make sure to lock up all the other drawers (but Row 1) at the end of your trip.\\  
There is a power strip plugged in at the bottom of R4.01.  It has USB outlets for phones.  Please do NOT use any 220 rack for powering equipment.  If you need additional power, you may use unused plugs in any cabinet at the end of the Row, like 3.08 or 2.08.

The closest hotel is the Holiday Inn.
They are a bit pricy if a conference is going on, but is walkable with good weather.\\

\\
Expect to spend about $15 per lunch and $25-30 for dinner, depending on where you go. \\
The Holiday Inn has OK food and is open later than other places. \\
There's world-reknown pizza available at Malnati's, but it's a lot of food for a single person. \\ [[https://goo.gl/maps/8UNiPzNuzfZ1qsFV7]] \\
Of course for lunch, the home of the Chicago Hot Dog, Portillos. \\
