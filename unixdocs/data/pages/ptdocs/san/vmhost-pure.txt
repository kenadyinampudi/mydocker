====== Adding VMWare host - Pure ======

The first thing is to work out the proper ports.\\
We use a [[\\cdcpilns013.federalmogul.com\sandocumentation\engineering\hds\f1500\f1500 20514 port documentation.xlsx | port documentation Excel sheet]] to figure out a range of where things should go.\\ 
Then I can use [[http://cdcpilla023.federalmogul.com:22015/DeviceManager/ | Replication Manager ]] to roughly guess which ports of the range are least used and choose that.\\ 
The temptation will be to just choose the same port everything else uses.  This could lead to overloading a port. Try to spread the load out evenly, even if this means some ports are more densely assigned than others.\\ 


Next, I hop onto CDCPILLX151 to create the zoning scripts.\\
See the [[:newlpar#[Zoning Example] | existing example]] for LPARs.

Apply these to each switch, remembering to save afterwards.\\ 

==== Create HostGroups ====
Get the list of WWNs for a host and clear out all colons and other punctuation.\\ 
Use capitalization for the hostname.\\ 
  purehost create --wwnlist "20000025B5A8000D,20000025B5B8000D" CDCPILVM204

Go back and change the host group "personality" to match the server.  This enables the correct set of SCSI commands for the host.\\ 
  purehost setattr --personality esxi CDCPILVM204

Create a 50G root volume and mount on LUN 1.  (Pure doesn't allow LUN 0)\\ 
Use the hostname_LUN naming scheme for the volume.\\ 
  purevol create --size 50G CDCPILVM204_1
  
Connect the volume to the host.\\ 
  purehost connect --vol CDCPILVM204_1 --lun 1 CDCPILVM204
  
As a bonus, you can put the server into a hostgroup which will present all the cluster LUNs to the host in one swoop.\\ 
  purehgroup setattr --addhostlist CDCPILVM204 INFRASTRUCTURE
  
Done and done.
