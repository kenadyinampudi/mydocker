====== Adding a new Hitachi Array ======

General Steps
  * [[san:addnewhitachiarray#Add Users|Add users to the array directly]]
  * [[san:addnewhitachiarray#Add to HDvM|Add to Hitachi Device Manager]]

=== Add Users ===
Go to the IP address of the SVP.\\
%%http://10.131.10.27/%%\\
It will move to something like ... \\
%%https://10.131.10.27/dev/storage/836000441548/index.do%%\\
Modify the URL to go to "emergency.do"%%\\
%%https://10.131.10.27/dev/storage/836000441548/emergency.do%%\\
\\
Now, add the htnmuser ID using the password in the secret server.\\

=== Add to HDvM ===
  * Log into [[http://cdcpilla023.federalmogul.com:22015/DeviceManager/|Device Manager]]
  * Go to Administration Tab
  * Click "Add Storage System" and put in the appropriate information.
  * After the system is added, change the name to match the other storage systems.  "LOCATION_SYSTEMTYPE_SERIAL"

=== Post Steps ===
  * Make sure to add the array into the SAN switches.
  * Modify the port properties of the array to enable security.  This limits the LUNs a server sees to the LUNs you've allocated to it.
