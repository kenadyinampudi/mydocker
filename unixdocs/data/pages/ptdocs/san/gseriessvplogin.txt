====== G-series SVP Login procedures ======

This should work for the G800, G350 and G200 series servers.

  * Use RDP to log into the SVP @ IP address
  * Use "\SVP" and password from secret server for the initial prompt.
 
You should now have access to the SVP.
 
Check the services to make sure everything started.  Sometimes the services do not all start properly.  This is not a serious issue.  Click the "Open StorageDeviceList" button and ensure all services are started.

If you have a problem or are unsure, you may contact Hitachi Vantara support.  They will give you clear instructions on how to safely proceed.
