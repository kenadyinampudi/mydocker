This is a Pure FlashBlade.\\
[[https://taprpur002.pt.int.tenneco.com]]
A FlashBlade is similar to the Hitachi NAS device.\\
It's meant for NFS and CFS shares.\\ 
\\

To Do:\\
  * Check the entries in IMS, NLyte
  * Check the data IP.  Right now it's using a stolen 10.131.12.22
  * Figure out how to replicate this over to Philly.  Might need to be manual for now using rsync or something.
