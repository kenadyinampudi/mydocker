====== Hitachi SVP Reboot ======
Because of various issues with Java, the embedded Windows servers (SVPs) managing the Hitachi arrays need to be rebooted to clear out issues.

===== Symptoms =====
 
  * The initial symptom will be a failure to update the data in Device Manager.\\  The "Last Refreshed" date will be a week or more older.
  * Progressive symptoms include: 
    * raidcom failure
    * tuning manager failure 
    * Command Device failure
    * Weird connectivity issues.

===== Fix =====

  * Use the Microsoft Terminal Services Client (mstsc.exe) to RDP into the Service Processor.  Use the user name and password in the secret server to log in.
  * Click on "Start", then "Windows Security" then the little arrow next to the power icon on the lower right side to select "Reboot."\\ [[https://knowledge.hitachivantara.com/Documents/Storage/VSP_Gx00_and_VSP_Fx00/83-05-xx/SVP_Technical_Reference/Rebooting_the_SVP]]
  * Wait a few minutes
  * Ensure the SVP is still reachable
  * Attempt a refresh from HDvM

===== Troubleshooting =====


  * If other, more strange connections issues arise after the reboot, there are probably some services which did not properly start.
  * Click on "Open Storage Device list"
    * If the services show as "Stopped", click the inviting "Start Services" button to get things rolling.
    * The Storage array picture should now say "Ready" with a green indicator instead of grey.
