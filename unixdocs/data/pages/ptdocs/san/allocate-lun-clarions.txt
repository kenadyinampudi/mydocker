====  Adding more disk to a File Storage Pool ====



~filestorage
Storage  -> LUNs  ->  Create  
Choose the filestorage pool.
Choose a filesize (Up for grabs ... maybe 1TB?)
Choose "Name" to manually name the LUNs.
Filename should be something like "File_<arrayname>"
The starting LUN should be whatever the next number in the range of already assigend disks
The resulting Disks will be created.  The dialog should show disks with names of "File_<arrayname>_<LUN>"  (The undersscore is added automatically.)

Hosts -> Storage Groups  ->  ~filestorage 
With "~filestorage" highlighted, click "Connect Luns"
In the new popup, expand the "SPA" and "SPB" tree items.  You should see the newly created LUNs.
Select the newly created LUNs and click "Add".
They should now be visible in the bottom of the dialog box.  (They should be the only disks listed without a number in the "Host Lun ID" column, because they are not yet allocated.
A summary dialog will appear.  Double-check that the proposed operation matches what you intended.  Click "Yes" if it matches.

Give it a few minutes to finish adding the disks to the pool.

Next, have the pool discover the newly assigned disks.
Storage  ->  Storage Configuration  -> Storage Pools for File
In the bottom right corner under the "File Storage" section, click the "Rescan Storage Systems" Link.
Click "OK".  This is non-disruptive.  

Give it a few minutes to finish scanning.
The Storage Pool for the file data should eventually show the added disk.
It will show as potential MB at first.
