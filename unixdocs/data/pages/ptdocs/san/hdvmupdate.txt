====== Upgrading HDvM ======
One thing to remember is that our data is regularly sent to Hitachi via a crappy script.
It does not set the Java path correctly.\\ 
Whenever you upgrade HDvM on CDCPILLA023, remember to add this line into the /opt/HiCommand/HiCommandCLI/HiCommandCLI.sh script:
  export HDVM_CLI_JRE_PATH=/opt/HDVM/HBaseAgent/agent/JRE1.5/bin
\\
This allows the shipped java version to be found and the scripts to be executed.
