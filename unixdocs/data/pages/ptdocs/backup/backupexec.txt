  * First, go to [[https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html]] and click on licensing.
  * Sign in as "BackupAdministrator@federalmogul.com"  (Check secret server for details.)
  * Click on "Entitlements"
  * In the filter section, change the "Product Line" to "Backup Exec", change "Service Status" to "Active Service Contracts and click "Apply Filters"
  * Scroll over to the extreme right.  There will be a picture of a key for "Generate License".
  * On the next page, it will ask for you to select a product and a quantity.  Because this is a TB license, it's really asking "How many of your TB do you want allocated to this key?"  Keep the default of "4" for the TB.  Confirm the dialog by clicking "Generate"
  * Download the generated key by clicking on the "License Key" link, then hitting "Save" to get the file to download.
