====== Change Actifio Connector Port ======

Refer to the Actifio documentation at [[https://actifio.force.com/c2/kA2G0000000XZclKAG]]
\\ 
\\ 
==== Prereqs ====
First, determine the port which will be used for the Actifio connector.
The default port is 5106 as defined in the [[http://docs.actifio.com/9.0/PDFs/NetworkConfiguration.pdf|Network Configuration doc.]]
\\ 
Fun diagnostic techniques:\\ 
  * [[unix:portscan| Scanning from outside the server]]
  * [[unix:openports| Scanning from within the server]]
I chose to use non-standard port 8443 for this DMZ server behind a firewall.
\\ 
==== Steps ====
First I checked if there was anything already listening on the port using netstat.
  root on tsdv1d02:/var/act/log>netstat -Aan | grep LIST | grep 443

There was nothing on port 443 or 8443.
Then I added this line to the Actifio connector per the instructions:
  vi /act/config/connector.conf
  port = 8443

I restarted the UDS agent on the client side.
  root on tsdv1d02:/etc>/etc/udsagent restart
  Stopping udsagent...
  Starting /opt/act/bin/udsagent as a daemon
  root on tsdv1d02:/etc>
\\ 
The host was already added to CDCPILREP009, so I modified the settings to talk to the connector over port 8443.\\

Finally, I went to the application manager and discovered apps on the host just like usual.  I set up a job and ran the backup.\\
