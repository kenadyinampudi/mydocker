This will test the replicated stuff for valid host names prior to DR test.
You will be asked to choose the Protection Group to recover.
Usually, more than one protection group is used,
 so you may need to run this app more than once to cover everything.
Once you've picked a protection group to work with,
 a list of snapshots will be presented.  Choose the one closest to your DR time.
Finally, you will be asked to name the DR test.
 This will contain all the volumes to make clean up easier.
