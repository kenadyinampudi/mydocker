====== OpsCenter ======

Add a new LDAP domain to OpsCenter ...
  cd d:\program files\symantec\opscenter\server\authbroker\bin\
  vssat.bat listldapdomains

Like most LDAP implementations,you will need a user in the foreign domain.
You also need the full AD path to the user account.\\ 

  PT\CDCP-OpsCenter
  pt.int.tenneco.com/Federal-Mogul/Process/Application Users/CDC OpsCenter
  
Then you form the command using the full path and name.
This will take some guessing and checking to get correct.\\ 
Use vssat to add the domain. ***Note, this is a hidden feature.  It does not show up when you use the help feature of vssat.***
