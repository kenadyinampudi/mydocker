====== Rolling SUSE back ======
SUSE 12 using BTRFS uses "snapper" utility to maintain a list of snapshots of interesting points in time.\\
Usually whenever zypper makes changes or yast does something, a snapshot is taken.  \\

==== ROLLING BACK CHANGES ====
To roll back changes, get console access to the affected machine.  \\
Restart the machine with the console open and catch GRUB when it verifies the bootable image.\\
Usually snapshots with stars are major snaps the system thinks are important.  Those are a good choice if you do not have a good time in mind.\\
Boot to a command prompt.  The system should be usable and even remotely accessible at this point, though the root vol will be read-only.\\
If the system looks to be OK, make the rollback permanent by issuing ``snapper rollback``.  \\
If you do not want to keep the changes, just reboot and select something else.\\
