===== Workaround for using different ssh keys =====
As of October 2019, the ssh keys for root aren't added to boxes yet.  A workaround is to use the ssh config file to manually specify which key to use for which server.
\\ 
This is a bit of a kludge compared to our usual methods.\\
\\
  vi ~/.ssh/config
Make a new entry for every server using a different key. 
<code>
Host <servername>
        User root
        IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_dsa.pgnmsv01
</code>
