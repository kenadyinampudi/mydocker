====== Procedure to figure out a unique uid for a new service account ======

  - This is a very poorly written script.
    - It takes about 3-4 minutes to run
    - Currently it prints unique ids between "6000 and 7000"
  - Login to pgnmsv01<code>ssh pgnmsv01</code>
  - For a single uid, Execute this command. **There is no need to run this as root, I recommend running it as your own account(But make sure you have ssh keys setup )**<code>/prod/images/scripts/picknextuid</code>
  - If you need multiple, pass an argument<code>/prod/images/scripts/picknextuid <number_of_unique_ids_needed></code>
