====== Installing patches on HPUX ======

**Do not use the console to install patches - the console messages will messup the window. Always patch from a ssh session **

HPUX standard patch bundles are divided into 3 sets.

  * QPK1131
  * HWEnable11i
  * FEATURE11i

** Installing QPK1131 or Quality Pack **

  * [[unix:backupconfig-hpux|Perform configuration backup]]
  * Download the patch bundle from HP's website. This needs an HP passport login account.
  * Download the patches and store it in a central location. At tenneco, we store it under 'pgnmsv01:/prod/images/hpux'
  * From pgnmsv01, either nfs mount OR scp the file to the target server<code>cd /prod/images/hpux
scp hpux_11.31_01140520.tgz taitc114:/opt/oracle</code>
  * Logon to the server on it's console.<code>telnet taitc114-gsp</code>Login as Admin.  **Do not use the console to install patches - the console messages will messup the window. Always patch from a ssh session **
  * Unzip and untar the patches<code>cd /opt/oracle
gunzip hpux_11.31_01140520.tgz
tar xf hpux_11.31_01140520.tar</code>
  * Perform a sanity reboot - This is to make sure that the server is working okay as of now. These servers are rebooted very rarely, hence it is a good idea to reboot it once.<code>shutdown -r -y now</code>
  * Create the patch depot<code>cd /opt/oracle
./create_depot_hpux.11.31</code>
  * Install the patches<code>export LC_ALL=C.en_US
swinstall -s /opt/oracle/depot</code>
    * At the menu, use 'space bar' to select all the bundles listed. 
    * Then hit "m" to mark them for installation.
    * Hit 'tab' to get to the menus
      * Select Actions
        * Select Install
          * Hit 'OK' to install the patches.
  * Phew ....
  * After the system has come back up, cleanup the temporary location in this example ''/opt/oracle''
