====== Move a Red Hat Client into the patching process ======
In order to control the patching process, Red Hat implements a life-cycle policy in which a bundle of packages are promoted from dev to QA to prod.\\

This allows the administrator to update servers in a more controlled fashion.\\ 
Currently, registering a server directly to Red Hat will present packages which will update the server up to the latest and greatest for that major version.  This means that servers getting patched will be moved to the latest point release and will be at different versions depending on when servers were patched.\\ 

A 7.5 server patched today will end up 7.7 with the latest patches, where as one patched a month ago will have 7.7 but be missing patches from the last month in comparison.\\
