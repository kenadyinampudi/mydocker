====== SUSE Manager Troubleshooting ======

Sometimes a channel won't sync and will prevent you from doing an SP migration.\\ 
You can try manually running ''/usr/bin/spacewalk-repo-sync -c additional-sle-15-sp1''.\\ 
The '-c' will allow you to run a console during the update so you can check for errors, like missing GPG keys.\\
