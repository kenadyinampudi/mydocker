====== Migrating systems from one datacenter to another ======

This is a basic checklist for migrating a system from one datacenter to another.

==== Sanity Checks: ====

  * Do you know the root password?
  * Are there any external mounted file systems?
  * Are there any filesystems exported via NFS?
  * Is this server actually in a replication group?
  * Have the new LPARs been created at the target location?
  * Are the fabric zones created?
  * Have the hosts been created on the storage array?
  * Are there any aliases that will need to be changed after startup?
 
==== Prior to Event ====

  * Replicate the protection group.  Time it to finish 2-3 hours prior to start of cutover.
  * Get storage commands prepped.
  * Get resources lined up to change IP address
  * Consider commenting out any hard NFS mounts and any export files to make boot quicker on the new IP.
 
==== Cutover ====

  * Back up the system using existing backups
  * Shut down application (if necessary)
  * Doublecheck root password works.
  * Shut down server
  * Initiate snapshot from source location
    * Get the names of the new disks
    * <code>purevol list --snap *<snapname>*</code>
  * Copy the snapshots to actual volumes
    * <code>purevol copy oldname newname</code>
  * Map the new volumes to the host
    * <code>purevol connect --host <hostname> hostname</code>
  * Boot the system
  * Change the IP
  * Notify networking resource to change the DNS entry
  * Undo whatever fstab changes were made to quicken boot time
  * Reboot the box
  * Verify filesystems are mounted again
  * Verify any exports are mounted at destination
  * Reload aliases
  * Hand over server to application team for startup
  * Get backups configured for boxes
