====== Using Satellite to do an automated installation ======
This is most useful for remote sites where the LAN connection is really prohibitive for just mounting an OS install disk.

This is a fiddily process.  If you start getting strange errors and can't work around them, I suggest just deleting the host within Satellite and trying again from the beginning.  Sometimes it will not update itself properly after an initial mistake, even if you'ce corrected things.

=== Satellite Prep ===
  * Make sure the Location exists.
    * Administer -> Locations
    * Add country if necessary.
      * "New Location"
      * No parent
      * Name is two letter country code
      * Description is whatever
      * Submit
    * Add Site code
      * Admin -> Locations -> Click "New Location"
      * Select Country as Parent
      * Name is 4 letter site code
      * Description is whatever
      * Submit
    * Configure site
      * Select the site (Will probably already be selected for you)
      * Click on "Capsules" & Add everything
      * Click on "Provisioning Templates" and add everything
      * Click on "Partition Tables" and add everything
      * Click on "Domains" and add only those domains appropriate for that site
      * Click on "Organizations" and add all
      * Submit
  * Add a Subnet if necessary
    * Infrastructure -> Subnets -> Create Subnet
      * Add name.\\ Use "Site_Linux" to indicate the subnet.
      * **Description** is whatever makes sense.
      * **Network Address** is the subnet address.  (ends with .0 for /24, so ''x.x.x.0'')
      * **Network Prefix** is the CIDR number, usually "25" at the sites.
      * **Network Mask** should fill in automatically once the prefix is set.
      * **Gateway Address** is the gateway for the subnet. (usually ''x.x.x.1'')
      * **Primary DNS** should be the IP of the closest DC server.
        * [[finddccontrollers:how_to_find_current_dc_controllers]]
      * **Secondary DNS** should be the IP of the Infoblox (like 134.238.106.252)
      * **VLAN ID** is whatever makes sense.  It's not used
      * **Boot mode** needs to be static
    * Click "Remote Execution" tab
      * Select all
    * Click "Domains"
      * Select the appropriate domain for the site
    * Click "Capsules"
      * Change all dropdowns to "cdcpillx205"
    * Click "Locations"
      * Select the country and site for this site.
    * Under "Organizations"
      * Add "Tenneco"
    * Click **Submit**
==== Create Host Group ====
* Within Satellite, make sure a host group is defined for the server site.\\ A host group is essentially a set of default values for a host.
    * Go to "Configure" -> "Host Groups" and click "Create Host Group"
    * Under the "Host Group" tab
      * **Name** is the first 6 letters of the hostname, so "CDCPIL"
      * **Description** is whatever you want
      * **Lifecycle Environment** should be Tenneco/Library for now
      * **Content View** should be "RHEL 8.2 Base"
      * **Content Source** is "Tenneco/CDCPILLX205"
    * Under "Network"
      * **Domain** -> Select the domain appropriate for the site
      * **IPv4 Subnet** -> Select the subnet for the site
    * Under "Operating System"
      * **Architecture** -> Should be "x86_64"
      * **Operating System** should be "RedHat 8.2"
      * **Synced Content** should be "Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_8_for_x86_64_-_BaseOS_KickStart_8_2"
      * **Partition Table** should be "Dell PT LVM 100G"
      * **Root Password** should be standard password.
    * Under "Parameters"
      * Add Parameter "disable-firewall", Boolean, "true"
      * Add Parameter "enable-epel", Boolean, "false"
      * Add Parameter "ntp-server", String, "time.aspa.int.tenneco.com"
      * Add Parameter "selinux-mode", String, "permissive"
      * 
    * Under "Location"
      * Select the country and site to add to the "Selected items"
    * Under "Organizations"
      * Add "Tenneco"
    * Under "Activation Keys"
      * Add "eerbody" as a default
==== Building a new server with Satellite. ====
  - Click the "Hosts" -> "Create Host" button.
  - Give it the short name of the server
  - Organization is Tenneco
  - Location is the Site code
  - Host group is whatever is appropriate for the site
  - Everything else should populate automatically based on the host group settings

== Click on "Interfaces" ==


  - Edit the existing interface
  - Fill in the MAC address from the DRAC or from vCenter
  - Leave "Device Identifier" blank.  (Putting anything here will cause the server to not build)
  - Domain should match the server's FQDN
  - The IPv4 Subnet should be limited to subnets relevant to the domain.  If you don't see your subnet, add it.
  - "IPv4 Address" is the IP address associated with the name of the server.
  - Click OK
 
== Click on "Operating System" ==
  - Just double-check the values.  They should all be filled in as part of the host group.
  - Architecture is "x86_64"
  - Operating system is your desired level, RedHat 8.2 for example.
  - The "Synced Content" should automatically populate.  If it does not, set the "Architecture" to i386, then start at step 1 again.
  - "Partition Table" should usually be the "PT LVM 100".
  - "PXE Loader" should already be filled in with "PXELinux BIOS".
  - "Custom Partition Table" is blank
  - "Root Password" is the root password to use.  This is a mandatory field.
  - Click "Submit" and you should be dropped into a view of the host.

== Add Paramters Unique to this Host ==
  * Under "Parameters", fill out the following:
    * Add the following parameters:
      * ''driverdisk'' with a value of ''nfs:172.16.33.51/dell/drivers''
      * ''diskdest'' with the value of the disk path obtained Below, without the "/dev/", so something like ''disk/by-path/pci-0000:1a:00.0-scsi-0:2:0:0''

==== Getting the Disk Path Value ====
  - The value for "diskdest" will be wrong at first, because we don't know what the PCI address of the virtual drive is at first.
  - Download the "Full Host 'shorthostname' Disk"
  - Boot the server from the disk
    - The install will fail at first, dropping you at an error screen
  - "Hit "Ctrl-B", then "2" to get to the command line
  - ''ls /dev/disk/by-path'' and figure out the path to the virtual drive.  
    - This could be lots of things, so investigate the options presented.
  - Save the value you obtained somewhere
  - Go back into Satellite
  - Go to "Hosts" -> "All Hosts"
  - Find the server you just built
  - "Cancel Build" to cancel the existing build
  - "Edit" to change your values
  - Go to "Parameters"
  - Edit the "diskdest" with the value you just found out
  - Click "Submit"
  - Click "Build" to build the server again \\ You can click OK on the warning
  - Download the "Full Host 'shortname' Disk"
  - Boot the server from the new disk and the install should proceed.
==== Get Bootable CD ====

  - The button at the top should say "Cancel build" ... this indicates the build was successful and is waiting.  On the left, the "Build" field should have a green checkmark and say "Pending Installation"
  - Click the down arrow next to "Boot Disk" at the top right.  
  - Select the "Full Host 'shortname' image" to download a 60-70mb image which will load everything from the network.  
  
  This assumes the network settings are correct and that the InfoBlox at 134.238.106.252 is reachable from the subnet assigned to the server.
