====== Dell Firmware Update ======
\\
These are current instructions for updating Dell Firmware. \\
This makes use of the [[unix:dellrepositorymanager | Dell Repository Manager]] to generate an NFS share with all the Dell firmware drivers for use in the PTT/CA environment. \\
==== Preupgrade ====
  - Get permission to reboot the box.  All firmware updates (except the DRAC updates) will require the box to be rebooted to take effect.
  - Reboot the DRAC\\ This is a preemptive reboot.  Firmware updates can fail in unusual ways if the DRAC had not been rebooted in a while.  Rebooting the DRAC is a non-disruptive task.
  - Determine the current code level \\ 
There are three states a server will be in: \\
  * [[unix:dellfirmwareupdate#Current_iDRAC_Firmware | Current iDRAC version]]
  * [[unix:dellfirmwareupdate#iDRAC_Firmware_2.41.40.40_or_Newer | 2.41.40.40 or newer]]
  * [[unix:dellfirmwareupdate#iDRAC_Firmware_Older_than_2.41.40.40 | Older than 2.41.40.40]]

=== Current iDRAC Firmware ===
  * As of 12/10/2020, this means iDRAC is at version 2.65.65.65
  * Nothing more needs to be done to iDRAC.  Proceed to update the firmware as indicated below.

=== iDRAC Firmware 2.41.40.40 or Newer ===
  * As of 12/10/2020, this means iDRAC is at version 2.41.40.40 or higher
  * Proceed to update the firmware as indicated below. 
  * Make sure to select the iDRAC firmware update as well.  This will add a couple of iDRAC reboots to the process.

=== iDRAC Firmware Older than 2.41.40.40 ===
  * As of 12/10/2020, this means iDRAC is less than version 2.41.41.40
  * Manually update the firmware to version 2.41.41.40 first.
    * Copy \\cdcpilns013.federalmogul.com\iso\drivers\hpcc\iDRAC_Firmware\iDRAC-2.41.40.40-intermediate-firmware.d7 locally to your computer.
    * Go through the iDRAC "Update and Rollback" process.  
    * Select "File".
    * Choose the file you downloaded locally
    * Wait for the reboot, then proceed with [[unix:dellfirmwareupdate#iDRAC_Firmware_2.41.40.40_or_Newer | 2.41.40.40 or newer]]
