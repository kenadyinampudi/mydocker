====== Resetting Server From Recovery Mode ======

This command shold be used with cauition.  It was provided by IBM for the puroose of recovering the server profile data when it is in recovery mode. It is hereby notes that this comand was provided by IBM after submitting pedbg output fron both HMC's (tgprhmc5 and tgprhmc6) for analysis. It was noerd by IBM that this command is normaly executed when the server is in 'Standby" more.  The levels shown here 2 and 3 per IBM should not cause the server to power cycle.  **Again caution is urged when executing the  rstprofdata  command as several of the levels may result in a reboot / power cycle of the server.**  

<code> rstprofdata -m <system name> -l 3 -f backupFile </code>  if that does not wok then ty the following <code>  rstprofdata -m <system name> -l 2 -f backupFile </code> where <system name> is the managed system name.
