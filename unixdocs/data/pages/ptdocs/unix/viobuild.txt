====== Building a new VIO server ======
For storage, make sure the server is wired to the SAN.\\ 
For the initial build, only zone one path to one controller.\\
Wire the server to the switches.\\ 
Make sure each networking card is dual pathed.\\  
Configure the switch ports to be trunked but not port-channelled yet.\\  
Go to the VIO console window.\\  
 - Option 2. Setup Remote IPL (Initial Program Load)
 - Choose the port
 - 1. IPv4 - Address Format 123.231.111.222
 - 1. BOOTP
 - 1. IP Parameters
	- 1. Client IP Address (This LPAR IP)
	- 2. Server IP Address (The NIM server)
	- 3. Gateway IP Address (Gateway for the LPAR)
	- 4. Subnet Mask (Mask for the LPAR)
 - 2. Adapter Configuration
	- 3. Protocol
		- 2. IEE802.3 - Select this for VLAN tagging
 - 4. Advanced Setup: BOOTP
	- 5. VLAN ID - Enter the VLAN ID which matches the Client IP Address.  Make sure the VLAN is allowed on the trunk
 - 3. Ping Test	
  - 1. Run the test!
  
At this stage, if you don't have a good ping, doublecheck your settings first.
	Typos are the most common issue
Next, try the other ports
	There may be a miswire where the incorrect port is wired
Finally, have the networking team check their settings
	This is the least likely these days, as all the ports are now configured the same.
\\
After the VIO code is installed, install the proper multipathing software in the oem_setup_env.\\
Doublecheck that <code>bosboot -v</code> completes successfully.\\
Add the rest of the zones.  Multipath the fiber channel adapters to the multiple controllers\\
Once everything is all zoned, reboot the VIO, make sure it's back up to running, then check multipathing to make sure the disks are all resolved into one disk.\\
