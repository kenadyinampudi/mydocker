====== Check for an open port on a server from the outside ======
Sometimes you need to check for an open port on a server.\\ 
"Open" in this instance means a service is listening on your chosen port and is reachable from the outside world.\\
This is good for verifying if a particular service is up and running or if a given port is available in a pinch.\\ 

This not conclusive.  Maybe the service using that port just happens to be down.  But this makes for some quick and dirty diagnostic testing. \\
\\ 
\\
We will be using netcat (sometimes nc).  CDCPILLX055 already has it.\\

  cdcpillx055:~ # nc -z <server> <port>
  cdcpillx055:~ # echo $?

The "-z" means send zero bytes ... basically just check for the port.\\ 
The "echo $?" afterwards is to get the return code of the command.\\

  * "0" means the port was reachable on that server.
  * "1" means the port was closed on that server.
  * A hung attempt means there's probably a firewall blocking connections.

Here's a real life example.

SSH is open on this server.
  cdcpillx055-new:~ # nc -z 170.64.0.139 22
  cdcpillx055-new:~ # echo $?
  0

Telnet is closed on this server.
  cdcpillx055-new:~ # nc -z 170.64.0.139 23
  cdcpillx055-new:~ # echo $?
  1

Netbackup is blocked for whatever reason.

  cdcpillx055-new:~ # nc -z 170.64.0.139 1556
  
  ^C
