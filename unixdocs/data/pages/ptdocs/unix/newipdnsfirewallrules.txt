====== Securing DNS names, IP addresses and Firewall Rules ======

==== DNS Names ====

  * Unix systems GIOS manage follow a naming standard. (There are many exceptions - This note is to ensure we wont have new exceptions)

Example ''pagi3p01''

p --> Production (Landscape )
  p - Production
  d - Development
  q - QA
  t - Test
  x - Sandbox
a --> America (Geographycal location the application support)
  a - America
  e - Europe
  g - Global
gi --> GIS ( Application )
3p --> Type
  3p - 3rd party
  ap - App
  db - Database
  sv - Service etc
01 --> Serialnumber ( the second 3rd party server would be pagi3p02 )

==== IP Address ====

  10.0.48.0/24   --> America/Global public subnet
  10.0.49.0/24   --> America/Global backup subnet
  10.32.50.0/24  --> Europe public subnet
  10.32.51.0/24  --> Europe backup subnet
  10.32.60.0/24  --> Heavy backups - another backup subnet

There are some more - I think they are carried over from the past

  10.32.6.0/24
  10.0.0.5.0/24

==== Firewall Rules ====

  * These are the firewall rules a Tenneco Unix system needs when it is being installed in the DMZ
