====== Upgrading Red Hat servers from one minor version to the next using Satellite ======

This is a multi-step process.

==== On Satellite ====
  * Go to "Hosts", "Content Hosts" in the tree on the left.
  * In the search bar that says "Filter...", search for your system.  Alternatively, just scroll through the list to find it.
  * Click the link to go to the server's package screen.
  * In the "Details" tab, look for the "Content Host Content" section.
  * Click the small box with a pencil in the "Content View" to edit, matching the version you are upgrading to.
  * Click Save.
  * Click the small box with a pencil in the "Release Version" to edit, matching the version you are upgrading to.
  * Click Save.

==== On the Host ====
  * Issue \\ <code>subscription-manager refresh
yum clean all
yum makecache fast
yum -y update</code>

In theory, this should do everything.
You might need to wait a few minutes inbetween changing the "Content Host Content" on Satellite and manually refreshing the client's yum repository.
