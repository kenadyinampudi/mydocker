====== DSET report, or Dell Tech Support Report Collection ======
Dell engineering may occasionally ask for support logs. \\ 
These can be retrieved either directly through the iDRAC or via the command line using racadm. \\
I recommend racadm, but both directions are included below. \\
\\
===== Tech Support Logs via iDRAC =====
The location of the actual button may vary by iDRAC version, but the steps are the same. \\ 
{{ :unix:dset_collection.png?nolink&400 |}} \\ 
  * On the lefthand side, navigate to "Overview","Server", then "Troubleshooting". \\
  * In the center header, click on "SupportAssist"
  * Click on "Export SupportAssistCollection"
  * Save the file locally and upload it to where it needs to be.
===== Tech Support Logs via racadm =====
This is my preferred method.  Generates the logs locally.
  * ssh into the machine as root. \\ <cli prompt="#">cdcpillx055:/misc/sandocumentation/stats/nbrg dset # ssh nbrgdelx027

  * Use racadm to generate a set of logs. <cli prompt="#">[root@nbrgdelx027 ~]# racadm techsupreport collect -t SysInfo,TTYLog
Job ID = JID_973606366531
RAC1154: The requested operation is initiated.
Run the RACADM jobqueue sub-command, using the job id to check the status of
the requested operation.

  * Check on the status of the collection using racadm. \\ In this example, the job above is only 4% complete. <cli prompt="#">[root@nbrgdelx027 ~]# racadm jobqueue view
