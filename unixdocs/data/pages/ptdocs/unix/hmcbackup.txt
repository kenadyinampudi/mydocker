====== HMC Backup Data ======


==== CLI ====
Backing up HMC console data is most easily done from the command line.\\ 
  bkconsdata -r nfs -h <destination> -l "/<exportname>" -d "<directoryunderexport>" -i perfmon
  
In Philly, a share has been set up on the FlashBlade to save the data.\\ 
  bkconsdata -r nfs -h 172.16.33.51 -l "/hmc_backup" -d phlypahmc010 -i perfmon
  bkconsdata -r nfs -h 172.16.33.51 -l "/hmc_backup" -d phlypahmc011 -i perfmon

In CDC, a share has been set up on the Flashblade there\\
  bkconsdata -r nfs -h 10.131.12.22 -l "/hmc_backup" -d cdcpilhmc010 -i perfmon
  bkconsdata -r nfs -h 10.131.12.22 -l "/hmc_backup" -d tgprhmc7 -i perfmon
  
Note, the backups can take upwards of three hours if there is a lot of LPARs on the HMC.\\ 
\\ 
In the examples above, you would find the data for tgprhmc listed under NFS share \\ 
  10.131.12.22:/hmc_backup/tgprhmc7/HMCBackup_<date&time>.tgz

PHLYPAHMC010 would be in
  172.16.33.51:/hmc_backup/phlypahmc010/HMCBackup_<date&time>.tgz
==== GUI ====
This can also be done from the GUI.
Use "HMC Management" => "Console Management" in the tree, then "Backup Management Console Data"\\ 
Check the box to include performance data.\\ 
Use "172.16.33.51" as the server name, and "/hmc_backup" as the resource.\\ 
Remember to include the leading slash in the resource field.
