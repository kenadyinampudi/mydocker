====== Deinstall IBM Endpoint Manager Agent on AIX Servers.  ======
  
  * You must first stop the agent process before removing it, and you will have to manually remove directories left behind. 

  * To stop the applicaion <code> sudo  /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/SBESClientd stop </code>
  * To uninstall the TEM Client on non-Windows systems the simplest method is using the built in package managers <code> sudo  installp -u BESClient </code>
  * Because this is a non standard IBM Licensed Program Product and does not compleatly deinstall by removing all files it has created you will have to manually remove directories left behind. <code> sudo rm -rf /etc/opt/BESClient/ /var/opt/BESClient </code>
