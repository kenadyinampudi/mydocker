====== Get real adapter location codes for VIOS adapters ======

To get the adapter location for a given SEA, there are a few steps to go through.\\ 
\\ 
==== Log in as padmin ====
Get the shared ethernet name via CLI.\\
<code>cdcpillx055:~> ssh padmin@cdcpilpv025

$</code>

==== Get the SEA adapter name ====
A simple lsdev and grep will suffice.\\ 
<code>$ lsdev -type adapter | grep "Shared"
ent8             Available   Shared Ethernet Adapter
$</code>

==== Get the Etherchannel adapter name ====
Get the full details of the SEA and use that to get the name of the etherchannel.\\
<code>$ lsdev -dev ent8 -attr | grep real_adapter
real_adapter    ent7     Physical adapter associated with the SEA                                           True
$</code>

==== Get the real adapter names ====
Get the full details of the etherchannel adapter.\\ 
<code>$ lsdev -dev ent7 -attr | grep adapter_names
adapter_names   ent0,ent1      EtherChannel Adapters                           True
$</code>

==== Get the locations ====
Knowing the physical adapters associated with the etherchannel and SEA, get the physical codes.
<code>$ lsdev -dev ent0 -field name physloc
name             physloc
ent0             U78CB.001.WZS0P9S-P1-C2-T1
$ lsdev -dev ent1 -field name physloc
name             physloc
ent1             U78CB.001.WZS0P9S-P1-C2-T2
$
</code>

The adapters in this instance are two ports on the same card.
(C2-T1 and C2-T2).  T1 and T2 would go to separate switches for redundancy.
