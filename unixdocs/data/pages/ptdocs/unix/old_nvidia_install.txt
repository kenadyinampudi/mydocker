====== Old instructions for installing custom compiled NVidia drivers for SUSE 12. ======


<markdown>

Download the driver from [the NVIDIA  site]( http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)

###From console
Go to run level 3  
`init 3`

run the installer as root:  
`sh ./xxxxxx.run`

Confirm the driver version with   
`nvidia-smi -q`

If the driver has been updated, go to run level 5  
`init 5`


### Make sure the GPU permissions are set correctly
Sometimes the permissions get hosed.  Very they are all still OK after running the "nvidia-smi".  
The "nvidia-smi" creates the device files if they are not already present.
`ls -lart /dev/nvidia*`

You can make this permanent by adding "/etc/modprobe.d/50-nvidia.conf" with the following:
```
NVreg_DeviceFileMode=0666
```

!!! warning "The GUI will probably be hosed after this update."

The GUI for SUSE will probaly be hosed after this.  It seems to be a Gnome thing ... if you switch over to X instead, it runs just fine.  According to Engineering, the GUI is still needed so they can install certain programs on the cluster nodes.

In theory, this is not an issue if the configu channel has been applied.  The `/etc/systemconfig/displaymanager` and `/etc/systemconfig/windowmanager` files already have the defaults changed from Gnome to icewm.
