This is old document and its need to be updated

=== Get permission ===
Most new server additions require an approved change control to start the build process.\\
Most change controls require at least the Infrastructure Manager to email approval then attaching that approval to the change control before submitting the change control for approval.\\

=== Get IPs ===
  - [[https://10.131.2.22/ui/|Log into InfoBlox]] and search the IP subnet to see what's available.
  - Find an available name and IP
  - Attempt a ping to the IP just to make sure.
  - Add the name and IP to CDCPILLX055:/etc/hosts file
  - Send an email to someone at Microsoft team to add the server name into the pt.int.tenneco.com domain
  - Create a ticket to Networking team to add the IPs into InfoBlox to reserve the IPs.

    - PCC2:  LAN

=== Create server ===
  * Use whatever method you want to get the server built.  Make sure it's in the correct VM Cluster.  (Redhat/Suse for Unix managed servers, Infrastructure or whatever for Appliances.)

=== Validate backups ===
  * Get the server added to a backup policy and validate that the backup completes successfully.

=== Validate IPs resolve correctly ===
  * Use either %%ping%% or %%nslookup%% to validate the DNS resolution is working.

=== Close change control ===
  * Attach all the proof that you said you would provide in the testing section.
