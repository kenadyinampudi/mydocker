====== Migrating AS400s over to Pure ======

4 main steps

  - Stop Hitachi replication
  - Overwrite existing drives with copies
  - IPL the partition
  - Change zoning for the tape drives

===== Stop Hitachi replication =====
  - Log into CDCPILLX151 as storage
  - '' pairsplit -ISI5 -g <groupname>'' \\
This is necessary to ensure the disks are not corrupted partial copies from the Hitachi to the Pure.
===== Overwrite existing drives with copies =====
  - From CDCPILLX151 as storage, ssh into taprpur003
  - Issue the copy commands \\ ''purevol copy --overwrite ORIG_<AS400name>_VSCSI## <AS400name>_VSCSI##''\\ The overwrite portion will destructively ruin the destination drive, but this is OK and desired.  The ORIG disks are the copies from the Hitachi.
===== IPL the partition =====
  - From CDCPILHMC010, activate the <AS400name>new partition, making sure to choose the saved profile, not the current profile.  This should ensure you have the latest changes to the profile.
  - Double-check the memory, CPU and VLANS for the Ethernet adapters match the original partition profile.
===== Change zoning for the tape drives =====
  - From CDCPILLX151 as storage, swap all the device aliases for the moved partition.
  - ''no device-alias <name> pwwn <oldpwwn>\\ 
device-alias <name> pwwn <newpwwn>''

===== Troubleshooting tips =====
  * List out Pure volumes to double-check names with ''purevol list ORIG_*''
  * Fail back easily by activating the old partition. \\  - Log into CDCPILHMC010 \\  - Shutdown the new partition. "<AS400name>new"\\  - Activate the old partition "AS400name"
