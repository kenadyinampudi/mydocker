====== Get HMC IP From LCD Panel ======

Procedure to check the HMC IP address assigned to the service processor of an existing IBM system.
\\ 
1. Ensure all cables are plugged correctly. \\  
2. Find the server's FSP IPs: 
  Cycle the operator panel to #2 - where you see 3 characters A/B/C/D and M/N and T/P 
  Leave A/B/C/D where it is. 
  Select M 
  Select T 
  Now you can cycle to 30 
  when you press enter you get 3xxx 
  cycle and get 3000 and press enter 
  your IP will be shown. Maybe it is 192.168.3.147 
3. Open HMC terminal console  \\ 
4. ping the IP you have for the FSP. \\  
5. Cycle the operator panel to 3001 to get FSP2's IP address (HMC2 port on the back of the server).  \\ 
6. ping this IP  \\ 
7. IF you get a ping, then make a connection: 
  mksysconn -r sys --ip 192.168.3.147 --passwd abc123 
8. IF you do not get a ping, then get NETWORKS team to help you establish communication. Their router probably is not configured correctly.  \\ 
9. You can also confirm your network ports configuration on the HMC with ""netstat -rn""  \\
