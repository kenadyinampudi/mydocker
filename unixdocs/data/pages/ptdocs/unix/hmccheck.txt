=====To check the HMC IP address for an IBM chassis =====


Do this: 
  - Ensure all cables are plugged correctly. 
  - Find the server's FSP IPs: 
  Cycle the operator panel to #2 - where you see 3 characters A/B/C/D and M/N and T/P 
  Leave A/B/C/D where it is. 
  Select M 
  Select T 
  Now you can cycle to 30 
  when you press enter you get 3xxx 
  cycle and get 3000 and press enter 
  your IP will be shown. Maybe it is 192.168.3.147 

  - Open HMC terminal console 
  - ping the IP you have for the FSP. 
  - Cycle the operator panel to 3001 to get FSP2's IP address (HMC2 port on the back of the server). 
  - ping this IP 
  - IF you get a ping, then make a connection:\\
<code>mksysconn -r sys --ip 192.168.3.147 --passwd abc123 </code>
  - IF you do not get a ping, then get NETWORKS team to help you establish communication. Their router probably is not configured correctly. 
  - You can also confirm your network ports configuration on the HMC with ""netstat -rn""
