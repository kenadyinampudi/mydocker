====== IMS Inventory Scripts ======
Inventory scripts are in cdcpillx055:/scripts/inventory_script
  * Script gathers some basic LPAR definition from the HMCs.
  * It runs through the translation-matrix.txt and substitutes the second field as a friendly name for the LPAR name in the first field.
  * It then attempts to log into each LPAR to gather more interesting information from the OS.
  * Finally, a mount is made to the IMS upload location and the output is copied.  The mount is removed.

==== getlparinventory ====
//Main script.//  \\
HMCs are hard-coded in the "main" function.  
Grab a current list of LPARs and put it in a temp file  
Loop through the list and substitute names from the translation matrix  
Log into each entry not named "DoNotUse" and grab more information.

==== translation-matrix.txt ====
//CSV to provide a friendly name for LPARs//  \\
Format is ''LPARNAME,ACTUALNAME''  
This accounts for funky names for LPARs.  The "Actual" or "Friendly" name should be pingable by CDCPILLX055.  It's used for ssh.  
If you do not want an LPAR to show up in IMS, add an entry in the translation matrix for the LPAR but change the friendly name to "DoNotUse".
Example:  
  cdcpilpx004,cdcpilpv004
  21-F635B,DoNotUse                    
  sfldmiax102.andy,sfldmiax102         
  sfldmiax107-sap4001,sfldmiax107      
  sfldmiax108\ -\ sap4011,sfldmiax108  

==== output.tmp ====
//Working file for the script.//  \\
Temp file. Can be deleted if necessary.  Otherwise is overwritten every execution

==== output.txt ====
//final output for the script.//  \\
Contains the final output of the scripts.  Is overwritten every execution.
