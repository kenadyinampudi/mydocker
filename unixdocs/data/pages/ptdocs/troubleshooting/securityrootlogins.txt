====== Issue ======
We get a nasty-gram from security complaining that someone from CDCPILLX055 is trying to hack the servers by logging in as root.\\

==== Cause ====
This is the LPAR inventory script which attempts to automatically grab LPARs and pass the list off to IMS.  \\
In the process, the script attempts to log in with ssh-keys to each LPAR and gather some AIX specific information.\\
The legacy Tenneco servers don't have ssh-keys set up for our root account (my standards!) and consequently rightly deny the access attempt.  This generates a log entry, which bubbles up to the Spleunk server and causes a ServiceNow ticket to get generated, which is dutifully passed over to us.\\

==== Steps to reproduce ====
 *  Add a new Tenneco chassis to our environment.  The inventory script finds it and attempts a log in, causing the cascade of issues.\\

==== Workaround ====
The inventory script is at %%cdcpillx055:/scripts/inventory_script/getlparspecific%%.\\
Copy the translation_matrix for safety, add entries for the new servers.\\
  cdcpillx055:/scripts/inventory_script # cp translation-matrix.txt translation-matrix.txt.bak
  cdcpillx055:/scripts/inventory_script # vi translation-matrix.txt

The translation matrix file was originally made to change LPAR names into ones that matched IMS to aid in correlating entries.  I also added a quick little function that "DoNotUse" as a substitute name stopped all processing for that LPAR.  I make use of this to stop polling to the legacy Tenneco LPARs.
