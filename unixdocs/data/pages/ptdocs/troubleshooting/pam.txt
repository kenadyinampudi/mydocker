====== Troubleshooting Pam ======
 
LDAP is working, as confirmed by getent and su …
<code>[root@shnhcnlx035 log]# getent passwd leedsn16
leedsn16:*:617:617:Leeds, Nathan:/home/leedsn16:/bin/bash
[root@shnhcnlx035 log]# su - leedsn16

There was 1 failed login attempt since the last successful login.

You can also try verifying that the Domain Controller is working by executing an ldapsearch.\\
This does not verify your configuration, only that the domain controller is responding as expected.\\
  ldapsearch -x -h 10.135.17.73 -b 'dc=fedmog,dc=federalmogul,dc=com' -D 'leedsn16@fedmog' -W "(anr=leedsn*)"

PAM is complaining, as confirmed by /var/log/secure.
  Apr  5 00:56:50 shnhcnlx035 sshd[128371]: pam_succeed_if(sshd:auth): requirement "uid >= 1000" not met by user "leedsn16"
 
There’s a config in PAM to not allow user IDs under 1000 from logging in.  All the users in HPCC land are in the 600 range.
I modified /etc/pam.d/password-auth
<code>[root@shnhcnlx035 pam.d]# cat password-auth
#%PAM-1.0
# This file is auto-generated.
# User changes will be destroyed the next time authconfig is run.
auth        required      pam_env.so
auth        required      pam_faildelay.so delay=2000000
auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
auth        requisite     pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet_success
auth        required      pam_deny.so
 
account     required      pam_unix.so
account     sufficient    pam_localuser.so
account     sufficient    pam_succeed_if.so uid < 1000 quiet
account     required      pam_permit.so
 </code>
 
I ran the authconfig to add sssd into the pam configs, then I manually edited the password-auth to allow UID under 1000.
  authconfig --enablesssd --enablesssdauth --update
 
Appears to be working now.<code>
cdcpillx151:~ # ssh leedsn16@shnhcnlx035
leedsn16@shnhcnlx035's password:
Last login: Fri Apr  5 02:59:24 2019

-bash-4.2$ logout
Connection to shnhcnlx035 closed.
